This idiom refers to naive or unfiltered speech, often by children or the inexperienced, that may reveal unintended truths or create trouble. An image could depict a child blurting something surprising in a room full of shocked adults — capturing innocence and its impact."

This idiom means it's a crucial piece of advice emphasizing the importance of adapting one's actions, decisions, or strategies to the specific circumstances, prevailing conditions, or evolving realities of a situation. It advocates for pragmatism, flexibility, and careful assessment before responding, suggesting that effective solutions are those that are thoughtfully tailored to the unique context rather than being rigid or generalized. It's a call for situational awareness and intelligent response.

For a powerful image, envision a chess player pausing mid-move, their eyes scanning the entire board to assess the opponent's pieces and their own vulnerabilities before decisively moving a pawn, symbolizing thoughtful adaptation to changing circumstances rather than rigid adherence to a plan."

This idiom means it highlights the stark and often cruel disparity in the impact of the same event, condition, or crisis on different individuals or groups. It implies that what might be a period of minor inconvenience, temporary hardship, or even spiritual reflection for some, can simultaneously lead to complete devastation, irreparable loss, or utter ruin for others. It powerfully underscores the unequal distribution of suffering and the vast differences in people's vulnerability to external circumstances.

For a powerful image, envision a single, heavy rain cloud above a landscape, but on one side, figures are serenely meditating under light sprinkles, refreshed and calm, while on the other, the exact same rain has become a torrential downpour, washing away homes and possessions, illustrating how the same event brings vastly different outcomes for different people."

This idiom means it highlights the folly of attempting to divide, distribute, or make plans based on something inherently fragile, uncertain, or prone to breakage, implying that such an endeavor is impractical and likely to fail. It's used to describe situations where one is making premature calculations or definitive arrangements with components that are not yet stable, complete, or guaranteed, much like trying to count and divide raw eggs without cracking them.

For a powerful image, envision a person meticulously counting and assigning raw, fragile eggs into imaginary baskets, with several already cracked on the table, symbolizing the impracticality of making definitive plans with inherently unstable elements."

This idiom means it describes actions driven purely by intense rage or resentment, where an individual resorts to dishonest means like cheating or stealing not necessarily for personal gain, but primarily as an impulsive act of retribution or a destructive expression of their fury. It highlights how overwhelming anger can cloud judgment, leading to irrational and morally compromising actions, emphasizing that such acts are often fueled by raw emotion rather than calculated intent, and usually result in negative consequences.

For a powerful image, envision a person with eyes blazing in fury, wildly snatching a small item or subtly altering a score, their actions driven by uncontrolled rage rather than logical intent, symbolizing the destructive, impulsive nature of anger-fueled dishonesty."

This idiom means it straightforwardly emphasizes the fundamental principle that sustenance and success are the direct results of hard work and effort, and that idleness or laziness inevitably leads to deprivation and failure. It acts as a clear warning against procrastination and lack of diligence, highlighting that those who shun labor cannot expect to reap any rewards, thereby ensuring their own hardship and lack of provisions. It underscores the direct link between effort and outcome.

For a powerful image, envision a figure lounging idly in a lush field where others are diligently harvesting, while their own empty basket and gaunt appearance starkly contrast with the abundance around them, symbolizing how laziness leads to deprivation."

This idiom means it highlights the unfortunate human tendency for gossip, rumors, negative information, or scandalous news to disseminate with astonishing speed and reach, often far quicker than positive or neutral information. It suggests that sensational or damaging content captures attention rapidly and travels effortlessly through communities, emphasizing the pervasive and often destructive power of malicious or harmful communication that spreads like wildfire.

For a powerful image, envision a small, dark cloud of gossip emerging from one person's mouth and rapidly expanding into a roaring hurricane, engulfing an entire town before a gentle breeze of positive news can even begin to stir, symbolizing the rapid spread of negativity."
Images/3165.png,কুকুরকে একবার দরজা দেখালে মাথায় উঠবে।,"Show a dog the door once, it’ll climb on your head",Kukurke ekbar dorja dekhale mathay uthbe,Give him an inch and he’ll take an ell,"This Bengali idiom, ""কুকুরকে শুতে দিলে মাথায় চড়ে"" (Kukurke Shute Dile Mathay Chhore), means that ""If you show a dog the door once, it will climb onto your head."" This idiom means it cautions against giving too much leniency, familiarity, or a single opportunity to someone who is ill-mannered, opportunistic, or ungrateful, as they will inevitably take advantage of it and become overbearingly disrespectful or presumptuous. It highlights that even a small indulgence can lead to unchecked impertinence, emphasizing the need for firm boundaries with those who lack proper etiquette or respect.

For a powerful image, envision a dog initially invited politely inside a doorway, but then rapidly scaling furniture to perch triumphantly on a person's head, its smirk showing clear disrespect, symbolizing how a small indulgence can lead to overbearing presumption from an opportunistic individual."

This idiom means it emphasizes that one cannot fundamentally change their inherent nature, disposition, or ingrained characteristics, regardless of external circumstances, training, or desire. It asserts that basic traits are immutable, implying that a person (or thing) will always revert to their true, fundamental self, just as a dog, by its very nature, can never embody the calm, docile characteristics of a cow. It highlights the persistence of ingrained identity.

For a powerful image, envision a dog trying earnestly to mimic the docile chewing of a cow in a pasture, but inevitably breaking into a bark and chasing its tail, symbolizing how inherent nature cannot be fundamentally altered despite attempts to change."
Images/3167.png,কু-সংগে থাকার চেয়ে একা থাকা ভালো।,Better alone than in bad company,Ku-songe thakar cheye eka thaka bhalo,Better alone than in evil company,"This Bengali idiom, ""কুজনে সঙ্গী না থাকার চেয়ে একা থাকা ভালো"" (Kujone Songi Na Thakar Cheye Eka Thaka Bhalo), means that ""It's better to be alone than in bad company."" This idiom means it advocates for solitude over association with individuals who possess negative influences, harmful habits, or detrimental character traits. It emphasizes that the corrosive impact of ""bad company"" can far outweigh any perceived benefits of companionship, leading to moral decay, poor decisions, or negative consequences, making isolation a preferable and safer alternative for one's well-being and integrity.

For a powerful image, envision a person walking alone in a peaceful, clear space, while in the background, a chaotic, shadowy group of figures is pulling each other down, with the solitary figure deliberately choosing their unburdened path, symbolizing the wisdom of avoiding harmful companionship."
Images/3168.png,কেউই জ্ঞানী হয়ে জন্মায় না।,No one is born wise,Keui gyani hoye jonmay na,No man is born wise,"This Bengali idiom, ""কেউ জন্মগত জ্ঞানী নয়"" (Keu Jonmogoto Gyani Noy), means that ""No one is born wise."" This idiom means it highlights that wisdom, knowledge, and understanding are acquired through learning, experience, and effort over time, rather than being innate traits present from birth. It encourages a lifelong pursuit of education and growth, dispelling the notion that some individuals are simply born intellectually superior or inherently sagacious. It emphasizes that everyone starts with a clean slate and must actively strive to gain knowledge and develop wisdom.

For a powerful image, envision a newborn gazing with blank curiosity at a vast, empty canvas, while surrounding them, brushes and paints of knowledge and experience slowly gather, ready to be applied over a lifetime, symbolizing that wisdom is acquired, not innate."
Images/3169.png,কুকুরের পায়ে ঘি মাখা।,Applying ghee to a dog’s feet (wasteful),Kukurer paye ghee makha,To waste good things on the undeserving,"This Bengali idiom, ""কুকুরের পায়ে ঘি ঢালা"" (Kukurer Paye Ghi Dhala), means that ""Rubbing ghee on a dog's feet."" This idiom means it describes an utterly futile, wasteful, or misguided effort where a valuable resource or kindness is bestowed upon someone or something incapable of appreciating it, benefiting from it, or responding in the desired way. It implies that such actions are pointless because the recipient's nature or circumstances prevent them from valuing or utilizing the kindness, making the effort entirely lost, much like rubbing expensive ghee on a dog's paws, which offers no real benefit to the dog and wastes the ghee.

For a powerful image, envision a person meticulously applying a golden, shimmering substance (ghee) to a dog's indifferent paw, which immediately shakes it off onto the dusty ground, symbolizing a valuable effort utterly wasted on an unappreciative or incapable recipient."
Images/3170.png,রোম একদিনে গড়ে ওঠেনি।,Rome wasn’t built in a day,Rom ekdine gore otheni,Great achievements take time,"This Bengali idiom, ""রোম একদিনে তৈরি হয়নি"" (Rom Ek Dine Toiri Hoyni), means that ""Rome was not built in a day."" This idiom means it emphasizes that truly great or significant achievements, complex projects, or enduring successes require considerable time, persistent effort, patience, and gradual development, rather than instantaneous completion. It serves as a reminder that ambitious goals cannot be rushed and that substantial accomplishments are the result of sustained hard work and incremental progress over an extended period, discouraging impatience and promoting perseverance.

For a powerful image, envision a vast, intricate city slowly rising brick by brick, with countless figures working diligently over a long timeline, emphasizing that complex, great achievements are built through patient, incremental effort, not sudden creation."
Images/3171.png,বিপদ গেলে ভগবানকে ভুলে যাওয়া।,Forget God when trouble is gone,Bipod gele bhogoban ke bhule jaoya,"When the danger is gone, God is forgotten","This Bengali idiom, ""বিপদ গেলে ঈশ্বর ভোলা"" (Bipod Gele Ishwar Bhola), means that ""Forgetting God once danger passes."" This idiom means it critically highlights a common human tendency to remember and seek divine help or higher powers only during times of crisis, distress, or adversity, but to neglect or forget them once the danger has passed and life returns to normal. It points to a superficial or opportunistic faith driven by fear rather than genuine devotion, emphasizing human forgetfulness and ingratitude when no immediate threat looms.

For a powerful image, envision a person fervently praying in a storm, their face strained with fear, but as the sun breaks through the clouds, their posture relaxes and they turn away from the sky, forgetting the divine in their newfound calm."
Images/3172.png,ক্ষমা করো ও ভুলে যাও।,Forgive and forget,Khoma koro o bhule jao,Let go of grudges and move on,"This Bengali idiom, ""ক্ষমা করে ভুলে যাও"" (Khoma Kore Bhule Jao), means that ""Forgive and forget."" This idiom means it practically advises a two-fold approach to overcoming past grievances: first, to actively pardon the wrongdoing, and second, to release the memory of the hurtful event from one's mind, thereby moving past resentment and negative feelings. It advocates for complete emotional and psychological release from past hurts, suggesting that true healing and peace come from not just pardoning the person, but also letting go of the incident entirely, fostering personal well-being and freeing oneself from bitterness.

For a powerful image, envision a person extending an open hand in forgiveness, and simultaneously, the dark, thorny vines of a past memory shriveling and fading from their mind, allowing a serene light to fill the space where bitterness once resided."
Images/3173.png,ক্ষমা পরম ধর্ম।,Forgiveness is the supreme virtue,Khoma porom dhormo,Forgiveness is a noble quality,"This Bengali idiom, ""ক্ষমা পরম ধর্ম"" (Khoma Porom Dhormo), means that ""Forgiveness is the supreme virtue."" This idiom means it elevates forgiveness to the highest moral principle. It suggests that the act of pardoning wrongdoings, letting go of resentment, and releasing the desire for retribution is not merely an act of kindness, but a supreme expression of human character and spiritual righteousness. It champions compassion, empathy, and the ability to transcend anger, presenting forgiveness as a path to inner peace and moral excellence, and often implies that it benefits the forgiver as much as the forgiven.

For a powerful image, envision a person with a serene expression, extending a hand to diffuse an angry, fiery aura around another, and as the anger dissipates, a divine, golden light emanates from the forgiver, symbolizing the profound spiritual power and moral excellence of forgiveness."
Images/3174.png,ক্ষুধা থাকলে নুন দিয়ে খাওয়া যায়।,"If you’re hungry, you can eat with just salt",Khudha thakle noon diye khawa jay,Hunger is the best sauce,"This Bengali idiom, ""ক্ষুধা লাগলে নুন দিয়েও খাওয়া যায়"" (Kshudha Lagle Nun Diyoe Khawa Jay), means that ""If there is hunger, one can eat with just salt."" This idiom means it emphasizes that when one is genuinely hungry or in dire need, even the simplest, most basic, and unappetizing provisions become palatable and sufficient. It highlights the power of necessity to make one less picky or demanding, suggesting that true need overrides preferences for luxury or flavor. It champions resilience and adaptability in the face of scarcity, proving that true hunger makes even the bare minimum acceptable.

For a powerful image, envision a person with an expression of profound hunger, gratefully savoring a plain bowl of rice with just a pinch of salt, while luxurious, untouched dishes blur in the background, emphasizing how true necessity makes even the bare minimum satisfying."
Images/3175.png,ক্ষুধার জ্বালায় মাথা ঠিক থাকে না।,Hunger makes you lose your mind,Khudhar jwalay matha thik thake na,A hungry man is an angry man,"This Bengali idiom, ""ক্ষুধার জ্বালায় মতি স্থির থাকে না"" (Kshudhar Jwalay Moti Sthir Thake Na), means that ""The mind doesn't stay right due to the torment of hunger."" This idiom means it powerfully describes how extreme hunger can severely impair one's cognitive functions, judgment, and mental stability, leading to irrational behavior, confusion, or a loss of self-control. It highlights the overwhelming physiological and psychological impact of severe deprivation, suggesting that basic human needs, when unmet, can profoundly destabilize one's ability to think clearly or act rationally. It speaks to the desperate measures one might take under duress.

For a powerful image, envision a person with a shimmering, coherent mind (represented by clear light) that begins to flicker and distort into chaotic, fragmented patterns as their stomach emits a guttural roar, symbolizing how extreme hunger destabilizes one's mental clarity and rationality."
Images/3176.png,খড়ের গাদায় সুচ খোঁজা।,Looking for a needle in a haystack,Khore gadai such khoja,To search for something almost impossible,"This Bengali idiom, ""খড়ের গাদায় সূঁচ খোঁজা"" (Khorer Gaday Shuch Khoja), means that ""Searching for a needle in a haystack."" This idiom means it describes a task that is incredibly difficult, virtually impossible, or utterly futile due to the overwhelming volume of irrelevant information or objects in which one must find a tiny, specific item. It highlights the immense challenge of finding something rare or specific within a vast, disorganized, or homogeneous mass, emphasizing the frustration and near impossibility of such a search.

For a powerful image, envision a vast, golden haystack stretching to the horizon, with a tiny, gleaming needle almost imperceptibly buried within, while a solitary figure hopelessly sifts through the overwhelming mass, emphasizing the frustration of an impossible search."
Images/3177.png,"গড়া সহজ, ভাঙা কঠিন।","Building is easy, breaking is hard","Gora sohoj, bhanga kothin",It is easier to destroy than to create,"This Bengali idiom, ""গড়া সহজ, ভাঙা কঠিন"" (Gora Shohoj, Bhanga Kothin), means that ""Building is easy, breaking is difficult."" This idiom means it contradicts the common perception that destruction is simpler than creation. Instead, it highlights that while it might seem easy to initiate something or to superficially damage it, truly dismantling, undoing, or fully eradicating something—especially established systems, relationships, or reputations—is an arduous and complex task. It emphasizes the deep roots and intricate structures that make fundamental destruction far more challenging than initial construction, suggesting the lasting nature of what is built.

For a powerful image, envision a towering, intricate structure easily assembling itself with minimal effort, while a single, determined figure struggles immensely to dismantle even a small section of its deeply intertwined foundation, symbolizing the arduous task of truly breaking down what is built."
Images/3178.png,গভীর জলে ধীর বয়ে।,"In deep water, the flow is slow",Gobhir jole dheer boye,Still waters run deep,"This Bengali idiom, ""গভীর জলে ধীর গতি"" (Gobhir Jole Dhir Goti), means that ""It flows slowly in deep water."" This idiom means profound matters, significant changes, or deeply impactful events often unfold subtly, quietly, and gradually, rather than with dramatic speed or obvious commotion. It suggests that truly important developments happen beneath the surface, without immediate fanfare, requiring patience and keen observation to discern their slow, powerful progression. It highlights the quiet but immense force of underlying currents, both literally and metaphorically.

For a powerful image, envision a vast, placid body of deep water, whose surface remains undisturbed, yet beneath, powerful, unseen currents are slowly and inexorably shifting massive underwater structures, symbolizing that truly significant developments unfold subtly beneath the surface, far from superficial notice."
Images/3179.png,গরিবের কথা কেউ শোনে না।,No one listens to the poor's words.,Goriber kotha keu shone na,The advice of the poor is often ignored,"The Bengali idiom ""গরিবের কথা কেউ শোনে না"" translates to ""Nobody listens to the poor"" in English. Idiomatically, it means that people from less privileged or powerless backgrounds are often ignored or their opinions and needs are not valued by society, especially compared to those who are wealthy or influential. This phrase is used in situations where someone feels neglected, overlooked, or unappreciated simply because they lack social or economic power, such as in a family, workplace, or broader societal context. For an image to represent this idiom, picture a scene with a group of well-dressed people engaged in animated conversation, while a modestly dressed person tries to speak but is ignored, sitting quietly on the edge or in the background—capturing the sense of being unheard and excluded."
Images/3180.png,"গাধা গাধাই, তাকে যদি রাজার গাধা করো।","A donkey is a donkey, even if made the king's donkey.","Gadha gadhai, take jodi rajar gadha koro","An unworthy person remains so, regardless of position","The Bengali idiom ""গাধা গাধাই, তাকে যদি রাজার গাধা করো।"" translates to ""A donkey remains a donkey, even if made the king's donkey."" Idiomatically, this highlights that inherent nature or lack of ability cannot be altered by status or outward adornment; no matter what position or honor you give to someone foolish or incapable, they remain unchanged. It is used in situations where an unworthy person is given undue opportunity or status and still acts foolishly or fails. Imagine an image where a donkey, awkwardly wearing a crown and royal mantel, stands among stately horses in a king’s stable—looking out of place but unchanged in attitude."
Images/3181.png,গুজব খুব দ্রুত ছড়ায়।,Rumors spread very quickly.,Gujob khub druto chhoray,Rumors travel quickly,"The Bengali idiom ""গুজব খুব দ্রুত ছড়ায়"" means ""Rumors spread very fast."" Idiomatically, it highlights how rumors, gossip, or unverified information can travel from person to person far more rapidly than actual truth or facts, quickly influencing those involved or even entire communities. This phrase is used in any situation where misinformation, sensational gossip, or baseless news is spreading rapidly and shaping people's opinions or actions without proper evidence. For a highly detailed image capturing this idiom, imagine a bustling, colorful village marketplace filled with vendors and townspeople. In the foreground, a chain of varied people—old and young, men and women—lean in to whisper to one another, their expressions a mix of fascination, secrecy, and excitement. As each whispered message leaves a person’s mouth, the words visually transform into delicate, transparent birds or fluttering paper slips, each one carrying the rumor further. These rumor-birds swirl above the heads of the crowds, darting from ear to ear, weaving between stalls of bright fruits and fabrics. In the far distance, some villagers look up in confusion or alarm as the flock of rumor-birds quickly disperses above them, casting shadowy patterns on the ground to emphasize the far-reaching and uncontrolled spread of gossip. The image would be dynamic, vivid, and crowded, channeling the chaos and speed of unchecked rumors moving through an entire community."
Images/3182.png,গাঁয়ের মার না আপন দায়ে।,Village's beating doesn't hurt at home.,Gayer mar na apon daye,Betrayal by loved one is more painful,"The Bengali idiom ""গাঁয়ের মার না আপন দায়ে"" means ""The blow from the village is not as hurtful as your own wound."" Idiomatically, this expresses that faraway problems or threats feel less painful than the troubles or responsibilities you face personally. It is used when someone dismisses external or distant issues as insignificant in comparison to immediate, personal hardships. To visualize this idiom, imagine a person sitting with a pained expression, clutching a clearly injured arm, while a group of villagers in the distant background is involved in a commotion—perhaps arguing or throwing stones. The immediate focus is on the character's personal struggle, as their wound throbs vividly in the foreground, while the chaos of the village looks faded, small, and almost irrelevant, highlighting how personal pain overshadows external threats."
Images/3183.png,গ্রাম নেই তো রসগোল্লা কোথা।,"If there’s no village, where’s the sweet?",Gram nei to roshogolla kotha,Beggars can’t be choosers,"The Bengali idiom ""গ্রাম নেই তো রসগোল্লা কোথা"" means ""If there's no village, how can there be sweets (rosogolla)?"" Idiomatically, it conveys that if the essential foundation is absent, you can’t expect the results, rewards, or luxuries usually associated with it. Used especially when warning someone against unrealistic expectations or wanting benefits without groundwork. For an image, picture an expanse of empty countryside with dry, cracked earth and no houses in sight. In the foreground, a longing villager searches for a plate of rosogolla, only to find an empty plate beside a lone treestump. Far off, a mirage-like vision of a bustling, happy village with a sweet shop is seen, but it fades away as the reality is barren and silent, powerfully emphasizing lack of foundation."
Images/3184.png,"কারো তপোষ মাস, কারো বিনাশ।","Someone’s harvest month, someone’s ruin.","Karor toposh mash, karor binash",One person's gain is another's loss.,"The Bengali idiom ""কারো তপোষ মাস, কারো বিনাশ"" means ""One's fortune is another's ruin."" Idiomatically, it suggests that what brings good luck or benefit to one person may spell disaster for someone else. It is commonly used when one person’s progress, benefit, or happiness is achieved at the expense of another. To illustrate this idiom, envision a split field: on one side, a farmer joyously reaping golden crops under bright sunlight, his face beaming with satisfaction, while on the other side, just beyond a stark dividing line, another farmer stands devastated among wilted, dying plants, with storm clouds gathering above him. The contrast is sharp and emotional, highlighting the intertwined fate of gain and loss."
Images/3185.png,"কতো হাতি গেলো তল, মশা বলে কতো জল","So many elephants have drowned, yet the mosquito complains about too much water.","Koto haati gelo tol, mosha bole koto jol",Making a big fuss over nothing while ignoring much bigger issues,"The Bengali idiom ""কতো হাতি গেলো তল, মশা বলে কতো জল"" means ""So many elephants have crossed the water, and now the mosquito complains about its depth."" Idiomatically, it points out the irony or absurdity when someone insignificant complains or boasts about something that much greater or stronger people have easily managed before. It is often used to mock people who overestimate their own importance or difficulties, especially after many capable individuals faced the same challenge without complaint. For a detailed image, picture a broad river shimmering in bright daylight: huge, majestic elephants are seen calmly and confidently wading across, their massive bodies mostly above the water despite small ripples forming around them. At the riverbank, a tiny mosquito hovers on a blade of grass, staring nervously at the river and dramatically lamenting the “vastness” of the water, its tiny reflection exaggerating its worry. Other animals nearby—like deer or monkeys—watch with amused expressions, highlighting the mosquito’s comical overreaction juxtaposed with the elephants’ calm success. The mood is light, witty, and full of expressive contrasts to visualize the humor and message of the idiom.
"
Images/3186.png,কাকের মাংস কাক খায় না,A crow does not eat another crow’s flesh.,Kaker mangsho kake khay na,"People of the same kind or group often protect each other, even in wrongdoing","The Bengali idiom ""কাকের মাংস কাক খায় না"" means ""A crow does not eat the flesh of another crow."" Idiomatically, it communicates that members of a group, profession, or community do not harm one another—especially when it comes to their own interests or survival. It’s most commonly used to highlight situations where people protect or excuse the wrongdoings of their peers, sometimes at the expense of justice or fairness. This phrase is invoked when observing tightly knit groups who, despite external pressures or wrongdoing, refuse to criticize or take action against their own kind. For a detailed image, envision a gathering of glossy black crows perched on a wide, gnarly tree branch. Below the tree, bits of discarded food and scraps lie scattered, while the crows busily pick at everything except for the untouched, lifeless form of another crow on the ground beneath them. The flock’s eyes dart protectively at outsiders—such as a curious fox or human—making clear their unspoken code. Sunlight filters through tangled leaves, casting a somber yet united mood, capturing the silent loyalty among the crows and their determination not to betray their own."
Images/3187.png,কুঁড়ের অন্ন হয় না।,The lazy don’t get food.,Kunrer onno hoy na,The indolent can never thrive.,"The Bengali idiom ""কুঁড়ের অন্ন হয় না"" means ""The lazy do not earn food."" Idiomatically, it underscores the essential truth that without effort or hard work, one cannot expect to be rewarded or to survive; only the diligent and industrious can expect to prosper. This phrase is often used as a warning or lesson against laziness, particularly when someone is tempted to rely on luck or the generosity of others instead of their own exertion. For a highly detailed image, picture a vibrant farm field under a bright sun, where several villagers—men and women—energetically harvest golden, ripe crops with sickles and baskets, their faces showing contentment and pride in honest labor. In the cool shade at the edge of the field, an idle, solitary figure dozes beneath a sprawling tree, a tattered blanket covering him, with an empty bowl and a faintly visible rumbling stomach. The distant laughter and productivity of the busy group contrast sharply with the lone sleeper’s missed opportunity, and a flock of birds peck at grain spilled nearby, further emphasizing that even the smallest creatures benefit from effort while the lazy go hungry. The scene is rich with color, life, and contrasting energies, clearly illustrating the message that idleness reaps no reward."
Images/3188.png,কু-কথা বাতাসের আগে ছড়ায়।,Bad words spread faster than the wind.,Ku-kotha bataser age chhoray,Bad news runs fast.,"The Bengali idiom ""কু-কথা বাতাসের আগে ছড়ায়"" means ""Ill words travel faster than the wind."" Idiomatically, it warns that negative talk, slander, or gossip spreads even quicker than the fastest wind, often causing harm before it can be controlled. This is used in situations where harmful or malicious rumors proliferate quickly, affecting the reputation or peace of individuals or the community. For a vivid image, picture a bustling rural village under a breezy, cloud-streaked sky. Dark, swirling letters and shadowy words whoosh overhead like gusty wind, racing from house to house, slipping under doors and through open windows. Villagers—some worried, some whispering—look up as these spectral “kotha” shadows pass over their homes. The sunlight dims wherever the words touch, casting an anxious, contagious mood that visually captures the speed and reach of spreading rumors."
Images/3189.png,কুকুরকে এক ইঞ্চি দিলে মাথায় উঠে।,"Give a dog an inch, it’ll climb on your head.",Kukurke ek inchi dile mathay uthe,Give him an inch and he'll take an ell.,"The Bengali idiom ""কুকুরকে এক ইঞ্চি দিলে মাথায় উঠে"" means ""If you give a dog an inch, it will climb onto your head."" Idiomatically, it warns that giving even a small concession or unchecked freedom to someone likely to abuse it will result in them overstepping boundaries. This is said in situations where leniency leads to exploitation. For an illustrative image, show a modest, cozy home with a person first patting a dog gently at their feet. Gradually, the playful dog climbs up onto a chair, then jumps onto a table, and finally sits atop the person's head, wagging its tail mischievously while the surprised owner looks up in disbelief. Other family members glance on with expressions of shock, humor, and frustration, perfectly emphasizing the consequence of unchecked liberty."
Images/3190.png,কুকুরের তেলি ঘি হয় না।,Ghee doesn’t suit a dog's stomach.,Kukurer teli ghee hoy na,Habit is second nature.,"The Bengali idiom ""কুকুরের তেলি ঘি হয় না"" means ""Dog’s fat cannot be turned into ghee (clarified butter)."" Idiomatically, it teaches that certain things or people cannot be changed beyond their original nature, no matter the effort. This is said when futile attempts are made to dramatically improve someone or something inherently unsuitable. For a detailed image, imagine a rustic kitchen with pots of golden, glowing ghee lined up on a shelf. In the foreground, a confused dog gazes longingly at the ghee jars, its reflection in the shiny copper pots showing only a dog. A wise old cook shakes his head nearby, holding a recipe book open to a page marked ""Impossible Transformations,"" visually capturing the gap between wish and reality."
Images/3191.png,কু-সংগে থাকার চেয়ে একা থাকা ভালো।,Better alone than in bad company.,Ku-songe thakar cheye eka thaka bhalo,Better alone than in evil company.,"The Bengali idiom ""কু-সংগে থাকার চেয়ে একা থাকা ভালো"" translates to ""Better to be alone than in bad company."" Idiomatically, it means solitude is preferable to harmful companionship, as negative influences can lead one astray. It is used to encourage someone to avoid toxic friends or environments. For a striking image, show a peaceful person seated on a sunny patch of grass in a quiet meadow, reading a book with a serene smile. A little further back, a group of shadowy, loud figures gather under a dark, twisting tree, their faces animated with mischief and gossip. The solitary figure is bathed in warm light, while the crowd seems enveloped in dull, blue-gray mist, clearly illustrating the proverb’s message."
Images/3192.png,কেওই জ্ঞানী হয়ে জন্মায় না।,No one is born wise.,Keui gyani hoye jonmay na,Wisdom comes with experience.,"The Bengali idiom ""কেওই জ্ঞানী হয়ে জন্মায় না"" means ""No one is born wise."" Idiomatically, this underscores the idea that true wisdom and knowledge are gained through experience and education, not innate from birth. It is said to encourage learning from life and mistakes. For an evocative image, picture a small child, eyes wide with wonder, sitting at the base of a spiral staircase made of books. Adults of all ages climb the stairs above, some pausing to help those behind, while at the top of the staircase, soft golden light suggests understanding and wisdom reached only after effort and time, visually narrating the journey from ignorance to enlightenment."
Images/3193.png,কেবল মন দিয়েই মন জয় করা যায়।,Only with heart can you win a heart.,Keblo mon diyei mon joy kora jay,Heart alone buys heart.,"The Bengali idiom ""কেবল মন দিয়েই মন জয় করা যায়"" translates to ""Only with heart can you win hearts."" Idiomatically, it means genuine connection and empathy are what win people’s trust or love, not material gifts or superficial charm. Used to encourage sincerity. For the image, depict two people, young and old, facing each other with hands over their hearts under a flowering tree. A glowing, subtle light radiates between them, while in the background, others try to offer fancy presents or wave for attention to no avail, making the main figures, bonded by empathy, the emotional center of the scene."
Images/3194.png,বিড়ালের প্রাণ বড় শক্ত।,A cat’s life is very strong.,Biraler pran boro shokto,A cat has nine lives.,"The Bengali idiom ""বিড়ালের প্রাণ বড় শক্ত"" means ""A cat's life is very strong,"" echoing the proverb ""A cat has nine lives."" Idiomatically, it is used to describe someone who is remarkably resilient, constantly escaping danger, harm, or difficult situations, much like a cat that seems to survive every peril. This expression is typically used when someone repeatedly avoids disaster or hardship, astonishing others with their enduring luck or adaptability. For a richly detailed image, imagine a lively urban or village scene where a sleek cat dramatically leaps from a tumbling rooftop onto a narrow wall, narrowly missing a barking dog below. In the background, previous near-misses are hinted at: a tipped-over water jar, a leaping hawk barely missing the cat, and surprised onlookers—children and elders—watching from windows and alleys. The cat lands gracefully every time, its eyes shining with spirit, embodying both vulnerability and tenacity. The overall mood is action-packed, full of movement and admiration, emphasizing the cat’s almost magical survival skills and the essence of resilience that this idiom celebrates."
Images/3195.png,বিড়ালের তেলে বিড়াল ভাজা।,Frying a cat in cat’s oil (self-serving act).,Biraler tele biral bhaja,To get without spending.,"The Bengali idiom ""বিড়ালের তেলে বিড়াল ভাজা"" means ""Frying the cat with its own fat."" Idiomatically, this phrase describes exploiting someone by using their own resources or attributes against them, typically in a cunning or self-serving way. It’s commonly said when someone is made to unknowingly fund or enable their own detriment, often for the benefit or profit of someone else. The idiom is applied in situations where someone cleverly manipulates resources or trust belonging to another for personal gain, usually without the victim realizing the irony. For a highly detailed image, imagine a rustic Bengali kitchen aglow with warm, yellow light. In the center, a clever and slightly smug cook stands beside a sizzling pan placed over a clay stove. On the wooden countertop is a small pot labeled with a cartoonish cat, clearly signifying the source of the fat. Below the table, a plump, ginger cat peeks up with a wary, almost accusatory look as the aroma of cooking fills the room. The scene is bustling: utensils clatter, spices are scattered, and another villager peeks in, amused by the cook's sly efficiency. Wisps of fragrant steam curl from the pan, and the cook's eyes sparkle with mischief, perfectly capturing the ironic and exploitative essence of the idiom"
Images/3196.png,রোম এক দিনে গড়ে ওঠেনি।,Rome wasn’t built in a day.,Rom ek dine gore otheni,Great achievements take time.,"The Bengali idiom ""রোম এক দিনে গড়ে ওঠেনি"" means ""Rome wasn't built in a day."" Idiomatically, this expression emphasizes that significant achievements, grand projects, or lasting improvements require steady effort and time—success cannot be rushed or accomplished overnight. It is frequently used to encourage patience and perseverance, especially when someone is frustrated with slow progress or expects immediate results. For an evocative and detailed image, imagine an expansive cityscape under construction at sunrise: marble columns and arches rise partially completed, surrounded by scaffolding and bustling workers. Masonry workers carve stone blocks, painters decorate half-finished frescoes, and architects with scrolls of plans supervise the activity. On one side, artisans carefully place a golden statue atop a pedestal while in the foreground, children help carry small bricks with playful determination. The scene is filled with movement, purpose, and hope—sunlight spilling through clouds and illuminating dust motes swirling in the air, symbolizing the slow, steady progress of building something magnificent and enduring. The atmosphere is industrious but optimistic, vividly capturing the idiom’s lesson about patience and the value of sustained hard work."
Images/3197.png,বিপদ গেলে ভগবানকে ভুলে যায়।,"When trouble is gone, God is forgotten.",Bipod gele bhogoban ke bhule jay,We forget God when we are safe.,"The Bengali idiom ""বিপদ গেলে ভগবানকে ভুলে যায়"" means ""Once the trouble passes, God is forgotten."" Idiomatically, this highlights how people often turn to faith or seek divine help only during difficult times, but quickly forget gratitude or humility when their situation improves. It’s commonly used to point out selective devotion or thanklessness after a crisis is over. For a detailed image, envision a family anxiously praying at a small shrine amidst a raging storm outside, their faces filled with hope and desperation. As the sun returns and the sky clears, the family is seen laughing and feasting together on a bright courtyard, while the once-worshipped deity statue or altar stands lonely and neglected in the background, half in shadow, symbolizing forgotten gratitude when fortune returns."
Images/3198.png,ক্ষমা করো ও ভুলে যাও।,Forgive and forget.,Khoma koro o bhule jao,Let bygones be bygones.,"The Bengali idiom ""ক্ষমা করো ও ভুলে যাও"" means ""Forgive and forget."" Idiomatically, it encourages people to let go of past grievances and choose reconciliation over holding onto anger, offering the path to peace and renewed relationships. This is used after arguments or misunderstandings, suggesting all parties move forward without resentment. Imagine two people under a flowering tree: their hands clasp in renewed friendship, eyes soft and warm, while behind them lie discarded, cracked masks representing past animosities. Sunlight streams through the blossoms above, and white doves take flight, signifying a peaceful new beginning and the beauty of true forgiveness."
Images/3199.png,ক্ষুধা থাকলে নুন দিয়ে খাওয়া যায়।,"If hungry, you can eat with just salt.",Khudha thakle noon diye khawa jay,Hunger is the best sauce.,"The Bengali idiom ""ক্ষুধা থাকলে নুন দিয়ে খাওয়া যায়"" means ""When hungry, even salt with food is enough."" Idiomatically, it reflects how real need makes a person grateful for the simplest of things, teaching acceptance and contentment. This is said in situations of hardship, frugality, or when appreciating small mercies. For a detailed image, picture a weary traveler seated on the floor of a humble village hut, savoring plain rice and salt with a serene smile beside a flickering oil lamp, ignoring sumptuous feasts just outside the window; the night outside is vast, but the warmth of simple satisfaction fills the little room."
Images/3200.png,ক্ষুধার জ্বালায় বাঘও ধান খায়।,Even a tiger eats rice when hungry.,Khudhar jwalay bagh-o dhan khay,Necessity knows no law.,"The Bengali idiom ""ক্ষুধার জ্বালায় বাঘও ধান খায়"" means ""Even a tiger eats rice out of hunger."" Idiomatically, it shows that necessity can make even the proud, strong, or picky abandon their preferences and act out of character to survive. Commonly used when someone’s dire need compels unexpected or humble actions. For a detailed image, depict a powerful Bengal tiger crouched awkwardly in a paddy field beneath the moon, nibbling at green rice stalks, its posture and gaze reluctant but desperate. Shadowy villagers quietly watch from the field’s edge, expressing surprise and empathy, and small animals peer in wonder from nearby bushes, emphasizing the depth of hunger's influence."
Images/3201.png,খরার গাদায় সূঁচ খোঁজা।,Looking for a needle in a haystack.,Khorar gadai such khoja,To search for something very hard to find,"The Bengali idiom ""খরার গাদায় সূঁচ খোঁজা"" means ""Looking for a needle in a haystack."" Idiomatically, it describes a task that is extremely difficult or seems almost impossible due to overwhelming odds or a huge number of distracting details. It’s commonly used when someone is faced with a daunting or tedious search. For a detailed image, envision a vast, airy barn piled high with golden haystacks lit by soft daylight; in the center, a person kneels determinedly, using a small hand lens to comb through endless straw. A tiny needle glints faintly amid the hay, almost invisible, while farm tools and curious onlookers add to the sense of scale and effort. The mood is patient, meticulous, and faintly hopeful, visually embodying the idiom’s message."
Images/3202.png,খারাপ খবর বাতাসের চেয়েও দ্রুত ছড়ায়।,Bad news spreads faster than the wind.,Kharap khobor bataser cheye druto chhoray,Bad news travels fast.,"The Bengali idiom ""খারাপ খবর বাতাসের চেয়েও দ্রুত ছড়ায়"" means ""Bad news spreads even faster than the wind."" Idiomatically, it highlights how negative information, scandals, or gossip travels incredibly quickly through a community—often much faster than good news or the truth. It is used whenever a rumor or unfortunate event rapidly becomes common knowledge, influencing and alarming people before facts or reassurances can catch up. For a detailed image, imagine a lively village square with startled villagers: dark, swirling gusts of wind seem to carry scraps of parchment or shadowy wisps shaped like exclamation marks from house to house. Curtains flutter, people cluster by fences whispering and pointing, and children run wide-eyed, visually capturing the feverish and invisible velocity with which bad news spreads."
Images/3203.png,"গাধা গাধাই, সে যদি রাজারও হয়।","A donkey is a donkey, even if it’s the king’s.","Gadha gadhai, se jodi rajar-o hoy",Nature does not change with status.,"The Bengali idiom ""গাধা গাধাই, সে যদি রাজারও হয়"" means ""A donkey remains a donkey, even if he belongs to the king."" Idiomatically, it illustrates that someone's fundamental nature cannot be changed by an upgrade in status or wealth; a foolish or inept person will remain so, even with privileges or high position. It's a pointed way of mocking someone promoted beyond their abilities or when a promotion does not lead to real improvement. For an evocative illustration, picture a stately palace where a donkey, awkwardly draped in royal robes and a glittering crown, clumsily stands amid a row of noble horses or courtiers who exchanged bemused, skeptical glances. The donkey’s posture is stubborn and unbothered, oblivious to its surroundings, reinforcing the proverb’s humorous truth."
Images/3204.png,ঘর পোড়া গরু সিঁদুরে মেঘ দেখলে ডরায়।,Burnt cow fears a red cloud.,Ghor pora goroo sindure megh dekhle doray,"Once bitten, twice shy.","The Bengali idiom ""ঘর পোড়া গরু সিঁদুরে মেঘ দেখলে ডরায়"" translates as ""A cow whose shed once burned is afraid even of a red cloud."" Idiomatically, it describes someone who, having suffered a significant loss or trauma, is now excessively wary or frightened, even by harmless or small signs of trouble. It's most often used for people whose past experiences make them overly anxious or cautious. For the image, visualize a gentle cow standing anxiously in a sunny field, its shed in the background clearly charred and ruined. Above, a harmless red-tinted cloud glows in the sunset sky, but the cow’s wide, fearful eyes and trembling legs show it can’t distinguish real threat from mere reminder, while nearby villagers try to comfort it."
Images/3205.png,ঘরের কথা বাইরে বলা।,Speaking household matters outside.,Ghorer kotha baire bola,To wash one’s dirty linen in public.,"The Bengali idiom ""ঘরের কথা বাইরে বলা"" means ""Telling home matters outside."" Idiomatically, it warns against airing family secrets, problems, or private issues to outsiders, thereby risking gossip, judgment, or harm to one’s close ones. It’s commonly used as advice to maintain confidentiality or avoid publicizing internal disputes. For a descriptive image, imagine a traditional home with an open window from which a woman is seen gleefully gossiping to a circle of intrigued neighbors outside. Inside, another family member watches nervously, while the trailing words form actual speech-bubble ribbons drifting from inside to out, drawing more people in and visually spreading the private matters through the whole street."
Images/3206.png,ঘরের খাবার খেয়ে বনের বাঘ মারা।,"Eating home food, don’t hunt the forest tiger.",Ghorer khabar kheye boner bagh marar na,Using someone’s support or resources to achieve glory elsewhere without giving them credit.,"The Bengali idiom ""ঘরের খাবার খেয়ে বনের বাঘ মারা"" means ""Don’t eat home food and then go out to kill the forest tiger."" Idiomatically, it warns against turning against your own benefactors or being ungrateful to those who support and care for you. It’s said when a person betrays their own family, friends, or supporters after benefiting from them. For a vivid image, show a strong villager, still wiping his mouth after a hearty home-cooked meal, stealthily heading towards a dark forest with a spear in hand—his loving cook watches sadly from the doorway, while, in the distant jungle, a tiger’s watchful eyes gleam. Shadows on the ground symbolize the trail of trust and potential betrayal."
Images/3207.png,ঘরের শত্রু বিভীষণ।,The enemy inside the house is the worst.,Ghorer shotru Bibhishon,A traitor in the family.,"The Bengali idiom ""ঘরের শত্রু বিভীষণ"" means ""Vibhishan, the enemy within the house"" (Vibhishan being the traitorous brother from the Ramayana). Idiomatically, it refers to betrayal by someone within one's trusted family or circle—a traitor closer to home than any outside foe. It’s invoked when a group or family is hurt or sabotaged by one of its own members, often unexpectedly. For a powerful image, depict a warm, lantern-lit family gathering inside a house, but one figure stands in the shadows near the door, exchanging furtive glances or passing a secret message to a shadowy outsider. Broken chains, torn photos, or weeping family members hint at the internal rupture and the pain of betrayal by someone trusted."
Images/3208.png,"ঘুঘু দেখেছ, ফাঁদ দেখো নি।","You’ve seen the dove, not the trap.","Ghughu dekhechho, phad dekho ni","Seeing only gain, not danger.","The Bengali idiom ""ঘুঘু দেখেছ, ফাঁদ দেখো নি।"" means ""You’ve seen the dove, but not the trap."" Idiomatically, it cautions against being enchanted by beauty, rewards, or surface-level charm without recognizing the hidden risks or dangers that may accompany them. It emphasizes the importance of awareness and critical thinking before making decisions or trusting appearances. This idiom is often used in situations where someone is being naïvely drawn toward something attractive—be it a business offer, a relationship, or an opportunity—without realizing the possible negative consequences lurking beneath. For a detailed image representation of this idiom, imagine a tranquil forest clearing softly lit by golden evening sunlight. At the center, a radiant white dove with iridescent feathers sits peacefully on a low-hanging branch, glowing gently against the foliage. Below it, camouflaged among fallen leaves and delicate wildflowers, lies a rusty iron trap, its sharp jaws poised and ready to spring. A curious young traveler, with a look of awe and innocence, stretches out a hand toward the bird, completely unaware of the danger beneath. Forest creatures—rabbits, deer, and squirrels—watch silently from the shadows, their eyes reflecting concern. The contrast between the bird's divine serenity and the hidden peril of the trap below captures the idiom’s essence, warning viewers that beauty and danger often coexist."
Images/3209.png,ঘুমন্ত কুকুরকে ঘুমাতে দাও।,Let the sleeping dog sleep.,Ghumonto kukurke ghumate dao,Let sleeping dogs lie.,"The Bengali idiom ""ঘুমন্ত কুকুরকে ঘুমাতে দাও।"" means ""Let the sleeping dog lie."" Idiomatically, it suggests that one should avoid stirring up trouble or revisiting past issues that are currently dormant. It advises against unnecessary provocation that might awaken conflict or difficulty. This idiom is often used when someone is tempted to revisit an old argument, expose a resolved issue, or meddle in a matter that is best left alone. For a vivid image, imagine a calm rural setting at dusk where a brown dog is sleeping peacefully under the shade of a banyan tree. Nearby villagers walk quietly, intentionally avoiding making noise. A curious child, unaware of the warning, tiptoes close with a stick in hand. The scene captures both stillness and underlying tension, emphasizing the idea of not disturbing peace that might turn into chaos."
Images/3210.png,ঘুমন্ত কুকুরের মুরগি ধরা যায় না।,You can’t catch a chicken from a sleeping dog.,Ghumonto kukurer murgi dhora jay na,The indolent can never thrive.,"The Bengali idiom ""ঘুমন্ত কুকুরের মুরগি ধরা যায় না।"" translates to ""You can’t steal chickens from a sleeping dog."" Idiomatically, it teaches that even those who appear idle or inattentive might still be alert and protective. It’s often used to caution against underestimating people based on their calm demeanor or silence. For instance, a competitor might seem inactive but can suddenly act to defend their interests. For the image, envision a moonlit village poultry yard where hens cluck softly in a coop. A dog lies beside them, eyes closed, seemingly asleep. However, a sly fox sneaks in only to be met with the dog's sudden, fierce growl. The dog's body remains still, but one eye is half-open, watching. This image captures hidden vigilance under the guise of rest."
Images/3211.png,ঘুমন্ত সিংহের হরিণ ধরা যায় না।,You can’t catch a deer from a sleeping lion.,Ghumonto shingher horin dhora jay na,The indolent can never thrive.,"The Bengali idiom ""ঘুমন্ত সিংহের হরিণ ধরা যায় না।"" means ""You can't catch a deer from a sleeping lion."" Idiomatically, it implies that even if a powerful force is momentarily inactive, its strength and dominance remain intact. It’s used in contexts where someone misjudges silence or inaction as weakness, thinking they can take advantage. For example, underestimating a wise leader or influential person because they seem quiet or passive. For a symbolic image, imagine a golden grassland where a majestic lion rests on a large rock, sunlight glinting on its mane. A deer peeks from the tall grass, tempted to venture near but hesitating due to an instinctive fear of the lion’s latent power. The entire frame reflects tension, strength, and caution born of experience."
Images/3212.png,"ঘুরে আসে শিশুর রূপে, শিশুরই অন্তরে।","Returns as a child, in a child’s heart.","Ghure ashe shishur rupe, shishur-i ontore","As the boy, so the man.","The Bengali idiom ""ঘুরে আসে শিশুর রূপে, শিশুরই অন্তরে।"" means ""Returns in a child’s form, with a child’s heart."" Idiomatically, it symbolizes rebirth, renewal, or the pure essence of innocence returning into the world. It’s used in spiritual, philosophical, or affectionate contexts—when describing a new life that carries the essence of someone past or pure-hearted. For the image, picture a dewy morning in a tranquil village. A glowing child in white traditional attire runs barefoot through flower fields, laughing joyfully. Behind the child, a soft translucent silhouette of an elder figure seems to guide them lovingly. Birds fly overhead as golden light filters through trees, symbolizing rebirth and eternal innocence."
Images/3213.png,ঘাড়ে দেখলে খাড়া।,The neck looks straight when seen.,Ghar-e dekhle khara,Give no chance to an intruder.,"The Bengali idiom ""ঘাড়ে দেখলে খাড়া।"" means ""Stands straight when watched."" Idiomatically, it describes people who only behave properly or efficiently when they know they are being observed. It’s often used to criticize someone’s lack of discipline or sincerity—be it a student, employee, or even a whole system that functions only under strict supervision. For a vivid image, envision an untidy classroom where students are talking, some doodling, others sleeping on desks. Suddenly, the teacher opens the door, and in an instant, the scene transforms—students sit straight, books open, and eyes forward. The visual split in behavior perfectly illustrates the idiom’s warning about superficial obedience."
Images/3214.png,ঘোড়ার আগে গাড়ি জোড়া।,Yoke the cart before the horse.,Ghorar age gari jora,Doing things in the wrong order.,"The Bengali idiom ""ঘোড়ার আগে গাড়ি জোড়া।"" means ""Putting the cart before the horse."" Idiomatically, it highlights the absurdity or ineffectiveness of doing things out of logical order. It’s used in situations where people rush into action without proper planning, such as launching a product before market research, or deciding on results before working. For a vivid image, picture a dusty village road where a heavy wooden cart is awkwardly hitched in front of a confused horse. The cart is filled with hay and clay pots, and onlookers—farmers, villagers—watch in amusement and dismay. One elderly man shakes his head, pointing at the mess, while the horse struggles to move forward, tangled and bewildered. The scene perfectly captures disorder caused by misaligned priorities."
Images/3215.png,চকচক করলেই সোনা হয় না।,All that glitters is not gold.,Chokchok korlei shona hoy na,Appearances can be deceptive.,"The Bengali idiom ""চকচক করলেই সোনা হয় না।"" translates to ""All that glitters is not gold."" Idiomatically, it warns that flashy appearances can be deceptive and that one should not equate external shine with genuine value. It's applicable when judging people, objects, or opportunities that appear attractive on the surface but lack depth or authenticity. For a detailed image, imagine a marketplace at dusk with golden lights glinting off shiny trinkets on a merchant's stall. A curious buyer holds a glittering bracelet with awe. In contrast, an unnoticed, dull-looking lump of real gold lies in a dusty corner, ignored by most. An old jeweler watches knowingly, smiling at the irony. The image captures the essence of surface vs. substance."
Images/3216.png,চক্ষু মন্দ তো জগৎ মন্দ।,"If the eye is bad, the world is bad.",Chokhu mond to jogot mond,All seems yellow to the jaundiced eye.,"The Bengali idiom ""চক্ষু মন্দ তো জগৎ মন্দ।"" means ""If the eyes are bad, the world seems bad."" Idiomatically, it reflects how one’s perception—especially if clouded by negativity—can distort reality. It’s used to describe cynical people who project their own bitterness onto everything around them. For the image, visualize two identical village landscapes side by side: on one side, the scene is viewed through clear glass—vivid green fields, children playing, and birds flying freely. On the other side, the same view is seen through cracked, grimy glass—everything appears dull, broken, and grey. A person peers through both lenses, unaware that the distortion lies not in the world but in their sight."
Images/3217.png,চেষ্টায় সিদ্ধি।,Success comes by effort.,Chestae siddhi,Practice makes a man perfect.,"The Bengali idiom ""চেষ্টায় সিদ্ধি।"" means ""Success comes through effort."" Idiomatically, it encourages perseverance, reminding us that determination and hard work are the keys to achievement. It's frequently used to inspire someone facing challenges—be it in education, career, sports, or personal growth. For a striking image, imagine a lone climber in snow-covered mountains, exhausted but determined, gripping an ice axe. The sun begins to rise, illuminating a glowing peak ahead. Behind the climber, a winding trail with signs of past struggle—slips, footprints, and rest points. At the summit, a small flag awaits, fluttering gently, symbolizing the reward of persistence. The entire scene radiates the triumph of effort over hardship."
Images/3218.png,চঞ্চল মনের প্রশ্রয় বা অর্থে সঞ্চয় হয় না।,A restless mind or money doesn’t save up.,Chanchol moner proshroy ba orthe sonchoy hoy na,A rolling stone gathers no moss.,"The Bengali idiom ""চঞ্চল মনের প্রশ্রয় বা অর্থে সঞ্চয় হয় না"" means ""A restless mind gathers no wealth."" Idiomatically, it teaches that someone who is fickle, impatient, or always distracted will never accumulate savings—financial or otherwise. Used to urge focus, patience, and consistency in effort and finances. For a detailed image, imagine a youth sitting at a desk with coins and papers, but constantly looking out the window or playing with gadgets. Around him, the coins seem to slip through his fingers like water, while diligent friends in the background steadily accumulate neat piles of savings. Scattered, drifting papers and fleeting thought bubbles show his mind wandering, highlighting the cost of restlessness."
Images/3219.png,চরেও কাঁটা আছে।,"Even in grazing lands, there are thorns.",Chareo kanta ache,No rose without thorns.,"The Bengali idiom ""চরেও কাঁটা আছে"" means ""Even in the riverine meadow, there are thorns."" Idiomatically, it says that even in seemingly easy or pleasant situations, there are hidden dangers or difficulties. Used to caution against overconfidence or ignoring risks. For an image, show lush, green riverbanks where cows and goats graze contentedly. But in the tall grass, sharp thorns or hidden traps prick one animal, causing it to jump. Shepherds nearby look up in concern, while the backdrop shows the serene beauty masking latent trouble—contrasting peace with the hidden danger."
Images/3220.png,চাচা আপন প্রাণ বাঁচা।,"Uncle, save your own life.",Chacha apon pran bacha,Everyone for himself.,"The Bengali idiom ""চাচা আপন প্রাণ বাঁচা"" means ""Uncle saves his own life first."" Idiomatically, it refers to self-preservation or selfish behavior in a crisis—everyone ultimately looks out for themselves. Used when someone abandons others to protect themselves. Picture a sinking boat, with people desperately trying to escape. One older man (the ‘uncle’) is already paddling away in a small raft, saving himself first while others call out for help, clearly illustrating the idiom’s focus on self-preservation."
Images/3221.png,"চোর বলে, ছুঁচ, তোর মাথায় একা ফোঁড়া।","The thief says, needle, you have a single hole on your head.","Chor bole, chuch, tor mathay eka phora",The pot calls the kettle black.,"The Bengali idiom ""চোর বলে, ছুঁচ, তোর মাথায় একা ফোঁড়া"" means ""The thief accuses the needle of having the only hole on its head."" Idiomatically, it highlights hypocrisy—when someone guilty of a much greater wrong criticizes another for a minor fault. Used when a big wrongdoer blames a small one. Visualize a courtroom: a sly thief points accusingly at a tiny needle on the table, while his own bag bulges with stolen goods. Onlookers gasp at the irony, and the needle is framed in a tiny spotlight, contrasted with the thief’s obvious guilt."
Images/3222.png,"চোরের বিদ্যা বড় বিদ্যা, ধরা না পড়লে।","A thief’s skill is great, if not caught.","Chorer biddya boro biddya, dhora na porle",Nothing like stealing if undetected.,"The Bengali idiom ""চোরের বিদ্যা বড় বিদ্যা, ধরা না পড়লে"" means ""A thief’s skill is great—if he isn’t caught."" Idiomatically, this recognizes cunning or trickery as impressive, but only as long as it remains undetected; the moment one is caught, the cleverness evaporates. Used in situations where success by dishonesty is admired only until exposure. For the image, imagine a masked thief skillfully picking a lock at night, gold coins twinkling in his bag. In the shadows, a policeman creeps closer, suggesting the ever-present risk of getting caught—a tense, almost theatrical scene between talent and threat."
Images/3223.png,চোরের বামুনের কপালে জোগ না।,A thief’s Brahmin has no luck.,Chorer bamuner kopale jog na,Good wine needs no bush.,"The Bengali idiom ""চোরের বামুনের কপালে জোগ না"" translates as ""A thief Brahmin’s fate brings no luck."" Idiomatically, it suggests that pretended virtue or holiness cannot change one’s unfortunate destiny, especially if dishonest. Used when someone’s façade cannot save them from consequences. Picture a man ironically dressed as a holy priest, but hiding stolen items under his robe. A divine symbol glows above others’ heads, but the ‘priest’ stands in shadows, his forehead furrowed in worry, subtly signifying the futility of false virtue."
Images/3224.png,চেষ্টা ছাড়া কিছুই হয় না।,Nothing happens without effort.,Chesta chara kichui hoy na,"Nothing ventured, nothing gained.","The Bengali idiom ""চেষ্টা ছাড়া কিছুই হয় না"" means ""Nothing happens without effort."" Idiomatically, it’s a straightforward encouragement to work hard to achieve anything worthwhile. Used to motivate perseverance. Show an upward climbing path: one person sits exhausted at the bottom while another, sweating but determined, climbs steadily toward a shining goal at the top of the hill—clear and optimistic, radiating the value of effort."
Images/3225.png,চেষ্টার আধায় কাজ নাই।,"Without enough effort, there’s no result.",Chestar adhai kaj nai,"Try your best, and you will win.","The Bengali idiom ""চেষ্টার আধায় কাজ নাই"" means ""A half-hearted attempt achieves nothing."" Idiomatically, it stresses that incomplete, insincere, or lazy efforts rarely lead to results. Used as advice when someone slacks off or lacks dedication. Illustrate a person only partly digging a well, water just trickling into a dry pit, while a nearby fully dug well overflows. Others shake their heads as the lazy worker sighs, dissatisfied and surrounded by unfinished tasks."
Images/3226.png,"চোখ দিয়ে কিছু দেখলে, নিজেকে দেখা যায় না।","If you see through eyes, you can’t see yourself.","Chokh diye kichu dekhle, nije ke dekha jay na",One cannot see their own faults.,"The Bengali idiom ""চোখ দিয়ে কিছু দেখলে, নিজেকে দেখা যায় না"" means ""Through the eyes, you can see everything, but not yourself."" Idiomatically, it points to self-blindness—one easily sees others’ faults, never their own. Used to caution against judgmental attitudes. For a dramatic image, imagine a group looking into a huge, sparkling mirror; they see everyone behind them but their own face remains misty or absent from the reflection, highlighting self-ignorance."
Images/3227.png,চোখ হলো মনের জানালা।,Eyes are the windows to the mind.,Chokh holo moner janala,The eyes are the window of the soul.,"The Bengali idiom ""চোখ হলো মনের জানালা"" means ""The eyes are the window to the mind."" Idiomatically, it expresses that emotions and thoughts are most clearly seen through the eyes, which reveal what’s within. In situations about honesty or deep emotion. For a poignant image, capture two faces in profile, their eyes glowing with emotion and subtle reflections—joy, sadness, or love—shimmering like scenes inside the pupils; a metaphorical open window frames the eyes, reinforcing the link to the heart and mind."
Images/3228.png,"চোখের আড়াল, মনের আড়াল।","Out of sight, out of mind.","Chokher aral, moner aral",Absence begets forgetfulness.,"The Bengali idiom ""চোখের আড়াল, মনের আড়াল"" means ""Out of sight, out of mind."" Idiomatically, it shows how absence causes people or things to be forgotten. Used when separation leads to fading memories. Visualize a photo fading on a dusty mantelpiece, with the person in it walking away into a misty distance while the room behind grows empty and cobwebbed—conveying the quiet loss of emotional presence"
Images/3229.png,ঘোড়া চুরি হয়ে গেলে গোয়াল বন্ধ।,Locking the stable after the horse is stolen.,Ghora churi hoye gele goyal bondho,To be wise after the event.,"The Bengali idiom ""ঘোড়া চুরি হয়ে গেলে গোয়াল বন্ধ"" means ""Locking the stable after the horse has been stolen."" Idiomatically, it criticizes taking action too late—acting only after disaster strikes. Used for belated precautions. For the image, show an empty stable with a broken door flapping open, the owner nailing shut the lock while neighbors glance at a hoof trail leading off. Behind, a distant horse silhouette gallops away, and the scene’s regret is clear."
Images/3230.png,"শেয়ালের সাথে দৌড়, কুকুরের সাথে শিকার।","Run with the fox, hunt with the hound.","Sheyaler sathe dour, kukurer sathe shikar",Acts both sides; double-dealing.,"The Bengali idiom ""শেয়ালের সাথে দৌড়, কুকুরের সাথে শিকার"" means ""Run with the fox, hunt with the hound."" Idiomatically, it’s about duplicity—someone who sides with all parties, pretending loyalty to both opponents. Used in politics or social scheming. For a visual, imagine a person splitting in two directions on a forked path: one side, slyly laughing with foxes; the other, hunting gleefully with dogs. Forest creatures watch skeptically, reflecting the double-dealing."
Images/3231.png,একে অপরের মনের ভাই।,Each other’s soul brother.,Eke oporer moner bhai,Like draws like.,"The Bengali idiom ""একে অপরের মনের ভাই"" means ""Brothers of each other’s mind."" Idiomatically, it highlights deep understanding, affection, or perfect compatibility between people. Used for true friends or soulmates. For a serene image, two friends sit side-by-side under a tree, their shadows merging into one as they laugh and share secrets, surrounded by subtle heart shapes and golden sunlight, visually showing heartfelt connection."
Images/3232.png,শয়তান ধর্মগ্রন্থ শুনে না।,The devil doesn’t listen to scripture.,Shoytan dhormogrontho shune na,You cannot reform a rogue.,"The Bengali idiom ""শয়তান ধর্মগ্রন্থ শুনে না"" means ""The devil does not listen to scriptures."" Idiomatically, it means some people remain unmoved by wisdom, advice, or morality, regardless of repeated teaching. Used regarding incorrigible behavior. In the image, show a dark, impish figure covering its ears as wise elders read holy texts; a golden, glowing script streams towards him but is blocked by a shimmering, stubborn shield of darkness."
Images/3233.png,"যেমন পার্টি, তেমন সাক্ষী।","As the party, so the witness.","Jemon party, temon sakshi",The company you keep reflects on you.,"The Bengali idiom ""যেমন পার্টি, তেমন সাক্ষী"" means ""Such is the party, such is the witness."" Idiomatically, it means like attracts like, or dishonest people draw dishonest supporters and testimony. Used when doubting the integrity of groups or alliances. For an image, depict a courtroom: a shady main figure stands confidently, while witnesses behind him wear masks that match his own, all smirking knowingly at the judge who frowns in awareness of their collusion."
Images/3234.png,ছাই ফেলে ভাঙ্গা কুলো।,"Throw away the ash, break the winnow.",Chhai fele bhanga kulo,To get rid of one after use.,"The Bengali idiom ""ছাই ফেলে ভাঙ্গা কুলো"" means ""Throwing away ashes with a broken winnowing basket."" Idiomatically, it signifies the futility of using something useless—an effort doomed to fail. Used when attempts are made with inadequate tools or means. For a visual, show a villager at the edge of a field, tossing ashes through a cracked and leaky winnow, the wind scattering gray dust everywhere while disappointed family members watch and unused healthy baskets sit nearby. The sense of waste and frustration is clear."
Images/3235.png,ছাই মাখলেই সন্ন্যাসী হয় না।,Smearing ash doesn’t make one a monk.,Chhai makhlei sannyashi hoy na,It is not the hood that makes the monk.,"This Bengali idiom ছাই মাখলেই সন্ন্যাসী হয় না। means that simply adopting the outward symbols or appearance of something—for example, covering oneself with ashes, as monks or ascetics traditionally do—does not make someone genuine or truly devoted; true identity and intent are determined by inner qualities, not by superficial acts or displays. It is typically used to point out hypocrisy, superficiality, or the folly of judging someone by appearance alone. For an image that brings this idiom to life, picture the serene banks of a holy river at sunrise, bathed in a soft golden glow. In the foreground stands a man conspicuously smeared all over with grey ash, dressed in freshly donned saffron robes, and pretending to meditate. But his posture is awkward, and his eyes furtively glance about, betraying his unease. Nearby, authentic sannyasis—aged, peaceful, and with gentle, knowing smiles—sit quietly, immersed in prayer or tending to humble tasks, their robes faded and their ash markings unadorned but sincere. Pilgrims bustle in the background, some glancing skeptically at the pretender. The contrast in the authenticity of expressions, the subtlety of movements, and the difference in their attire immediately signal who is genuine and who is not—the entire scene visually reinforcing that true devotion and identity cannot be achieved through mere external imitation."
Images/3236.png,ছিদ্রান্বেষণে বহু বিপত্তি।,Seeking faults brings many troubles.,Chhidranweshone bahu bipotti,Small faults can cause great harm.,"This Bengali idiom ছিদ্রান্বেষণে বহু বিপত্তি। means that constantly looking for faults or flaws in others leads to trouble or complications. It highlights the idea that those who habitually nitpick or criticize, searching for defects in everything, often create problems for themselves or spoil harmonious situations. For an image that brings this idiom to life, picture a busy workshop where a man scrutinizes a beautifully woven tapestry with a magnifying glass, his brows furrowed as he seeks the tiniest imperfection. All around him, craftspeople work peacefully, surrounded by vibrant, finished fabrics. However, as the man pokes and prods, loose threads begin to unravel, and a corner of the tapestry starts to fray. Some onlookers look annoyed, while others shake their heads in disappointment. The contrast between the serene weavers and the anxious faultfinder visually reinforces that nitpicking can disturb the beauty and harmony of a well-crafted whole, embodying the idiom’s cautionary message.
"
Images/3237.png,"ছুঁচ দিলে ফাল, ফাল দিলে বর।","Give a needle, get a thread; give a thread, get a groom.","Chuch dile phal, phal dile bor",People take advantage if given a chance.,"This Bengali idiom ছুঁচ দিলে ফাল, ফাল দিলে বর। means that a small action or object can lead to something bigger, and giving something bigger may lead to even more significant consequences. Literally, if you give a needle, you may be asked for thread; if you give thread, they might ask for cloth. It is used to describe how small requests can quickly escalate into bigger demands, often warning against indulging such incremental expectations. For an image that brings this idiom to life, visualize a bustling rural marketplace where a woman hesitantly offers a needle to her neighbor. The neighbor, with an expectant gesture, then asks for a spool of thread, and soon, pointing to her torn sari, she requests an entire piece of cloth. Onlookers watch the transaction unfold, some with amusement, others with a knowing smile, as the sequence of requests escalates. The scene captures the gradual transition from a minor favor to a bigger demand, emphasizing the slippery slope depicted by the idiom.
"
Images/3238.png,ছুঁচকে মারলে হাত গন্ধ।,"If you kill a mouse, your hand stinks.",Chuchke marle haat gondho,No gain from harming the powerless.,"This Bengali idiom ছুঁচকে মারলে হাত গন্ধ। means that even if you harm or attack someone insignificant, some of the trouble or 'stink' will inevitably come back to you. Literally, when you kill a skunk, your hand retains the smell. It is often used to warn that picking a fight with unsavory or problematic individuals, no matter how minor they seem, can lead to undesirable consequences for yourself. For an image that brings this idiom to life, picture a lush, green forest clearing where a person is seen striking a small skunk with a stick. Instantly, a thick, visible cloud of noxious vapor surrounds the person’s hand, and their face twists in disgust as the odor lingers. Animals nearby recoil, and the person is left alone, waving their smelly hand while others look on sympathetically or with caution. The vivid imagery of stink clinging to the hand visually represents the inevitable fallout of meddling with troublesome entities.
"
Images/3239.png,ছেঁড়া কাঁথায় শুয়ে রাজা হওয়ার স্বপ্ন দেখা।,"Lying in a torn quilt, dreaming of being a king.",Chhera kathaay shuye raja howar shopno dekha,Building castles in the air.,"This Bengali idiom ছেঁড়া কাঁথায় শুয়ে রাজা হওয়ার স্বপ্ন দেখা। means dreaming of being a king while lying under a torn or ragged quilt. It’s used for people who nurture grand ambitions or daydreams that are wildly unrealistic given their actual circumstances. For an image that brings this idiom to life, imagine a dimly lit, humble hut with cracked mud walls. In the center, a young boy or man lies stretched out beneath a patchwork quilt full of holes and tatters. Above him, a thought cloud swirls, filled with vivid images of palaces, crowns, rich food, and royal processions. The striking contrast between his modest reality and his lavish dreams is brought out through the stark difference in colors and textures, with the dull hut dissolving into the brilliant, golden fantasy in his imagination—perfectly illustrating the idiom’s message of impractical aspirations.
"
Images/3240.png,ছেড়ে দে মা কাঁদতে বাঁচি।,"Let me go, mother, so I can cry and live.",Chhere de ma kandte banchi,"Leave me alone, let me be.","This Bengali idiom ছেড়ে দে মা কাঁদতে বাঁচি। means ""Let go, mother, so I may cry and survive."" It is often used in situations where someone chooses to give up or escape a challenge simply to avoid further trouble, expressing a preference for freedom from struggle—even if it means facing sorrow or loss. For an image that brings this idiom to life, imagine a narrow, crowded village alley where a distressed child tries to wriggle free from his mother’s gentle but firm grip. Tears stream down the child's face as he extends his arms pleadingly, while the mother looks on with a mix of concern and resignation. Surrounding villagers watch with sympathetic or amused expressions. The focus on the emotional tension between holding on and letting go is mirrored in the desperate, teary face of the child, highlighting the idiom’s underlying theme of seeking release from hardship, even if it means being vulnerablity."
Images/3241.png,ছেলের খেলার মায়া।,The attachment to a child’s play.,Cheler khelay maya,Something trivial or insignificant.,"This Bengali idiom ছেলের খেলার মায়া। means the deep affection, nostalgia, and emotional attachment that parents, especially mothers, feel for their children’s innocent playtime moments. It conveys how a child’s simple, carefree games hold immense emotional value for adults, reminding them of innocence, fleeting youth, and the passage of time. For a detailed image, imagine a soft golden light bathing a rustic village courtyard at dusk, where a little boy is deeply engaged in building a toy house with sticks and clay. His mother sits nearby, momentarily pausing her chores, her eyes shining with gentle affection and a hint of nostalgia as she watches him. Maybe she smiles as the boy bursts out laughing after a small clay “wall” collapses, recalling her own childhood. Around them, the world seems to slow down: the fading sunlight filters through leaves, dust motes dance in the air, and even the animals nearby – a lazy dog, a curious goat – seem to share in the tranquil, precious moment. The scene is filled with warmth, tenderness, and a silent acknowledgment of how quickly these days will pass, making the mother linger on, enchanted by the magic of her child’s play."
Images/3242.png,ছোট ফাঁক বড় ক্ষতি করে।,A small gap causes big harm.,Chhoto fank boro khoti kore,Small faults can cause great harm.,"This Bengali idiom ছোট ফাঁক বড় ক্ষতি করে। means even a small gap, mistake, or oversight can result in significant damage or loss, emphasizing the importance of attention to detail and vigilance. It serves as a warning that neglecting minor issues can escalate into much larger problems. For the image, picture a massive stone dam holding back a swelling river during monsoon season. Among the sturdy blocks, a tiny crack seeps water, forming a thin but steady trickle. Villagers on the riverbank point in alarm as, below the dam, the ground grows muddy, and the water pressure on the crack grows. In the background, lush fields depend on the dam’s protection, and anxious faces watch as the small leak threatens to split the wall, foreshadowing disaster. The focus on the tiny leak contrasted with the looming flood illustrates how seemingly minor weaknesses, if ignored, can unleash calamity and destruction, bringing the idiom’s cautionary message to life."
Images/3243.png,"ঠাকুর ঘরে কে, আমি কলা খাইনি",Who's in the prayer room? I didn’t eat the banana.,"Thakur ghore ke, ami kola khaini",A sarcastic way to deny obvious guilt while clearly being the culprit,"This Bengali idiom ঠাকুর ঘরে কে, আমি কলা খাইনি (Thakur ghore ke, ami kola khaini) means someone acts overly innocent or denies wrongdoing even when it is obvious they are involved. It’s used humorously or sarcastically to point out hypocritical or blatant denial, especially when someone is caught red-handed but feigns innocence.
For a vivid scene, imagine the corner of a small village temple, lit by flickering oil lamps. At the center stands the prasad altar, where a sacred bunch of bananas is missing. Nearby, a child or young person looks around with wide, mock-innocent eyes and hands clasped together—banana peel sticking out of a pocket and traces of fruit still on the lips. An elderly priest stands with a knowing smile, pointing at the culprit, while villagers giggle in the background. The entire moment is thick with playful denial, visible crumbs of evidence, and the gentle humor found in everyone recognizing the truth despite protestations of innocence. This setting brings the idiom to life, illustrating how people often claim, “Who, me? I didn’t eat the bananas!” even when all signs point to them."
Images/3244.png,জলে জলে বাঁধ।,Dams in every water.,Jole jole bandh,Nothing succeeds like success.,"This Bengali idiom জলে জলে বাঁধ। means “building barriers in the water” or making futile efforts—pouring energy into something that is ultimately pointless, wasteful, or destined to fail. It often refers to doomed projects or stubborn attempts to control the uncontrollable. For an evocative image, imagine a group of villagers strenuously stacking sandbags and stones in the fast-flowing current of a rain-swollen river. The water constantly laps over and washes away their work, erasing their progress. Rain pours from a cloudy sky, soaking everyone, while others look on helplessly from the banks. Despite their best intentions and sweat, the rushing water wins every time, and their faces reveal frustration, exhaustion, and resignation. The damp, dreary atmosphere and ceaseless struggle make clear that these efforts, no matter how well-intentioned, are hopeless—embodying the idiom’s fatalism about wasted work."
Images/3245.png,জ্ঞানই বল।,Knowledge is strength.,Gyani bol,Knowledge rules the world.,"This Bengali idiom জ্ঞানই বল। means “knowledge is strength.” It expresses the belief that true power comes not from physical force or status, but from learning, wisdom, and understanding. For a detailed visualization, imagine a sunlit classroom where a studious child sits, surrounded by open books and glowing thought-bubbles containing images of discoveries, inventions, formulas, and wise teachers from history. Outside the window, in stark contrast, bigger children struggle to move a heavy object, straining with all their might but making little progress. The child inside, with a calm, confident expression, easily solves a puzzle or comes up with a clever plan, demonstrating that intellectual resources can solve problems physical strength cannot. Shelves filled with books and a caring, smiling teacher further reinforce the idiom’s core message: knowledge endows the greatest power of all."
Images/3246.png,জ্ঞানহীন উৎসাহ অন্ধ ঘোড়ার মতো।,Enthusiasm without knowledge is like a blind horse.,Gyanhin utsaho andho ghorar moto,Enthusiasm without wisdom is dangerous.,"This Bengali idiom জ্ঞানহীন উৎসাহ অন্ধ ঘোড়ার মতো। means that enthusiasm or zeal without proper knowledge or understanding is like a blind horse—energetic but dangerous and misdirected. People who act without sufficient awareness can cause chaos rather than progress. For an illustrative scene, picture a lively village road as an owner tries to restrain a spirited but blindfolded horse, which starts running wildly, scattering vendors and villagers alike. Pots fall, market stalls are knocked over, and everyone ducks for safety. The horse, full of strength and energy, charges around aimlessly, its potential completely wasted and even harmful. In one corner, a wise elder shakes his head while pointing to the scene, reinforcing the lesson that enthusiasm, when paired with ignorance, only leads to disorder."
Images/3247.png,জীবনের ছায়া ছাড়া কিছুই নয়।,Life is nothing but a shadow.,Jiboner chhaya chara kichui noy,Life is fleeting and insubstantial.,"This Bengali idiom জীবনের ছায়া ছাড়া কিছুই নয়। means “life is nothing but a shadow,” suggesting that existence is fleeting, insubstantial, and impermanent. It’s a meditation on mortality and the transient nature of worldly things. To visualize, picture a sprawling old banyan tree beside a quiet pond at sunset. Under the golden-orange sky, a solitary figure sits pensively, and their shadow stretches long across the grass, merging with the dusk. As the breeze rustles the leaves, ripples form on the water, and for a moment, both the figure and their shadow seem delicate, almost insubstantial. The stillness of the setting, the soft twilight colors, and the fragile, elongated shadow all blend to create a mood of introspection about life’s fleeting and illusory qualities.
"
Images/3248.png,"টাকা পাখি, উড়ে যায়।","Money is a bird, it flies away.","Taka pakhi, ure jay",Riches have wings.,"This Bengali idiom টাকা পাখি, উড়ে যায়। means “money is like a bird; it flies away”—money is difficult to keep, easy to lose, and tends to slip through one’s fingers quickly. For an image brimming with symbolism, picture a surprised man sitting at a desk, watching as a stack of banknotes and shiny coins sprouts wings and lifts off into the sky through an open window. The man’s outstretched hands reach after them in vain, and outside, the money-birds soar higher and higher, fading into the clouds. The room appears suddenly emptier, papers fluttering in the breeze left behind, underscoring the idiom’s message about the ephemeral and unpredictable nature of wealth.
"
Images/3249.png,টাকা থাকলেই মানুষ।,Only with money is one a person.,Taka thaklei manush,Money determines social status.,"This Bengali idiom টাকা থাকলেই মানুষ। means “one is considered important or respected only if one has money.” It points to the social reality that wealth often determines a person’s value or status in society. For a vivid scene, imagine a jovial gathering, perhaps a wedding or a festival, where a finely dressed wealthy man occupies the place of highest honor, surrounded by smiling, flattering faces eager for his favor. Meanwhile, at the periphery of the scene, a shabbily dressed but wise-looking man sits alone, ignored and overlooked by the crowd. The bright, polished colors around the rich man contrast with the muted background of the overlooked figure, plainly depicting the preferential treatment and social standing wealth can buy, regardless of true character."
Images/3250.png,টাকা দিলে কাজ হয়।,Work gets done if you pay.,Taka dile kaj hoy,Money makes everything.,"This Bengali idiom টাকা দিলে কাজ হয়। means “if you pay money, the job gets done,” referring to the power of bribes or financial incentives in influencing outcomes and getting things accomplished that would otherwise stall. For the visual, depict an administrative office: stacks of files and forms tower on the desks as a nervous applicant discreetly hands an envelope stuffed with cash to an indifferent clerk. As soon as the money changes hands, the clerk’s face lights up, and he begins to stamp and process the application speedily, while others without money wait impatiently in the background. The scene exposes the role of money in ‘greasing the wheels’ of bureaucracy, succinctly mirroring real-life experiences of getting things done through financial means."
Images/3251.png,টাকায় টাকায় বাড়ে।,Money increases with money.,Takay takay bare,Money makes money.,"This Bengali idiom টাকায় টাকায় বাড়ে। means “money accumulates little by little”—wealth is built gradually, coin by coin, and even small savings are important in the long run. For an evocative illustration, visualize an elderly grandmother patiently dropping one coin at a time into a large, battered earthen piggy bank. Over the years, coins pile up, and in the background, you see her simple home slowly gaining new possessions—a sturdy cot, a glass lantern, a basket of food—each item representing careful accumulation. The woman’s content smile, the soft play of lamp light, and the tactile sight of the mounting coins reinforce the idea that steady saving brings prosperity over time, echoing the saying’s wisdom."
Images/3252.png,টাকায় বন্ধুত্ব নষ্ট।,Money destroys friendship.,Takay bondhutto noshto,Money ruins relationships.,"This Bengali idiom টাকায় বন্ধুত্ব নষ্ট। means “money destroys friendship”—that financial disputes can spoil even the strongest relationships. To illustrate this, imagine two close friends caught in a heated quarrel in the middle of a bustling bazaar, their faces flushed with anger. At their feet, a pouch of coins has burst open, scattering money everywhere as onlookers watch in discomfort and dismay. A previously shared laughter is replaced by mutual accusations, and the distance between the two is marked by the spilled money. In the background, an old photo of the friends laughing together on a nearby wall or in their memories shows the contrast between what was and what is now, visually conveying how greed or financial conflict can poison even the closest bonds."
Images/3253.png,টাকার পাখা আছে।,Money has wings.,Takar pakha ache,Money is easily spent or lost.,"This Bengali idiom টাকার পাখা আছে। means “money has wings”—wealth can vanish as quickly and unexpectedly as if it could fly away. For a striking image, imagine an open household safe with bundles of notes and gold coins transforming into flocks of brightly colored birds, flying out through an open window into the sky. A family looks on in shock and helplessness as their savings evaporate before their eyes. Sunlight enters through the window, illuminating the empty safe and the flight of the “money birds,” powerfully depicting the precarious, elusive nature of financial security embodied in the idiom."
Images/3254.png,টাকায় নৌকা পাহাড় যায়।,"With money, boats climb mountains.",Takay nouka pahar jay,Money can achieve the impossible.,"This Bengali idiom টাকায় নৌকা পাহাড় যায়। means “with money, even a boat can go over a mountain”—with enough wealth, anything is possible, no matter how absurd or difficult. For a magical scene, picture a wooden boat perched on a steep, rocky mountaintop, impossibly balanced, while golden coins spill out from underneath, forming a path down to the valleys below. Amazed villagers at the base of the mountain point and stare, some shielding their eyes in disbelief. The sky above is bright and surreal, amplifying the fantastic possibility, while the cascade of shimmering coins visually evokes the message that money can 'move mountains' or defy all logic and barriers."
Images/3255.png,গরু বাছতে গ্রাম উজাড়।,The whole village is emptied to choose a cow.,Goru bachhte gram ujar,Overdoing a simple task causes big loss.,"This Bengali idiom গরু বাছতে গ্রাম উজাড়। means “to select one good cow, the whole village is laid waste”—criticizing actions where seeking a single gain leads to widespread destruction or waste far outweighing the benefit. For the image, visualize a once-thriving village reduced to ruin: houses empty, fields barren, and neighbors dispersed. In the abandoned village square, one proud individual leads away a magnificent cow, the only animal left among broken carts, trampled harvests, and forlorn villagers. The stark contrast between the solitary prize and the surrounding devastation drives home the cost of reckless or overly thorough selection, illustrating the idiom’s warning that gaining one thing at the cost of extensive loss is ultimately self-defeating.
"
Images/3256.png,চোরের ঘরে কে থোকে? আরামে তো কেউ খায় না।,Who knocks at a thief’s house? No one eats in peace.,Chorer ghore ke thoke? arame to keu khay na,"Wrongdoers live in fear, not comfort.","This Bengali idiom চোরের ঘরে কে থোকে? আরামে তো কেউ খায় না। means that nobody feels at ease or can truly enjoy comforts in a place of theft or wrongdoing. There’s always fear, anxiety, or a sense of guilt hanging over those who have something to hide; even in apparent comfort, a thief sleeps with one eye open. For the image, picture a dimly-lit, cluttered hut at midnight, valuables hastily piled on one side. A nervous thief lies on a straw mat, tossing and turning, sweat on his brow and ears cocked for every distant sound. Shadows flicker on the walls, and an open window offers an ominous view of the night outside. Though a hearty meal sits nearby, the thief stares at his food, appetite lost to worry. The tension and sense of unease contrast sharply with the illusion of material comfort, capturing how guilt and fear can ruin even the simplest pleasures."
Images/3257.png,তিক্ত শিক্ষা।,Bitter lesson.,Tiktto shikkha,A hard-learned lesson.,"This Bengali idiom তিক্ত শিক্ষা। means a bitter lesson—something learned through unpleasant, painful, or harsh experiences, often remembered for a lifetime and leading to meaningful growth. For a striking visual, imagine a young student in a rural classroom, his face downcast as he stands before a broken clay pot and spilled rice after being careless. The teacher watches with concern, not anger, and the classroom falls silent. Outside the window, storm clouds brew, symbolizing the adversity he faces. Over his shoulder, a thought bubble shows the boy next time, carefully carrying the pot without mishap. The lingering sadness in the moment—and the awareness dawning on the student’s face—evokes the emotional impact and unforgettable nature of this “bitter education.”"
Images/3258.png,তেলির ঘর খাঁদায় রক্ষা কর।,Protect the oilman’s house from the pit.,Telir ghor khaday raksha koro,Take care of your own weaknesses.,"This Bengali idiom তেলির ঘর খাঁদায় রক্ষা কর। means ""protect your household from fire if you live in an oil-seller’s house”—in other words, one must be extra cautious or watchful when living in risky or vulnerable circumstances, since a small spark can spell disaster. To visualize, imagine a modest dwelling stacked high with oil barrels and lamps. Inside, the residents move with great care, eyes watchful and cautious. A small child is gently stopped by her mother as she approaches a lamp, the father checking for leaks and double-bolting the storeroom. Outside, neighbors look in with concern, aware that even a minor accident could bring tragedy. Warm lamplight casts anxious shadows, capturing the ever-present awareness of danger and the value of vigilance."
Images/3259.png,জালে পড়লে বিড়ালও ইঁদুরকে ভাই ডাকে।,"In the net, even a cat calls a mouse brother.",Jale porle biral-o indurke bhai dake,"In trouble, even enemies become friends.","This Bengali idiom জালে পড়লে বিড়ালও ইঁদুরকে ভাই ডাকে। means that in times of mutual danger or crisis, even enemies or rivals will act friendly to survive—a cat caught in a net may call a mouse its brother. For the scene, picture a tangled fishing net left on the riverbank with both a terrified cat and a trembling mouse trapped side by side. Their eyes meet not in aggression, but in mutual desperation, as a fisherman’s heavy footsteps approach in the distance. For now, natural instincts are overridden by shared peril. The juxtaposition of natural enemies side by side, united in fear, creates a powerful image of crisis-driven alliances and temporary truces."
Images/3260.png,শক্তির নাম বাবাজী।,Power’s name is Babaji.,Shoktir nam Babaji,"Power commands respect, not virtue.","This Bengali idiom শক্তির নাম বাবাজী। means that many people put on a show of bravado or power—invoking “strength” as their master—but often it is mere bluster, not true courage. Used to mock those who talk big but lack substance. To paint this, envision a group of village youths surrounding one boisterous young man who puffs out his chest and swings a large stick, loudly boasting about his strength. Yet, behind his tough pose, he glances nervously behind him, and the others exchange amused looks. Some elderly villagers watch knowingly, shaking their heads, while a little child nearby mimics the bluster with a smaller stick in pantomime. The scene brims with a sense of mockery—bravado without true backbone."
Images/3261.png,চামচ থাকলে কাঁটা দরকার কী?,Why need a fork when you have a spoon?,Chamoch thakle kanta dorkar ki,Extra things are unnecessary.,"This Bengali idiom চামচ থাকলে কাঁটা দরকার কী? means when you already have a spoon, why do you need a fork—used to highlight unnecessary duplication, or having more than needed for the same job. For the image, imagine a well-set dining table where a child, confused, stares at a bowl of rice pudding with both a shiny spoon and a fork beside it. The mother gently removes the fork with a smile, indicating its redundancy. The background is filled with guests quietly enjoying their food, utensils clicked together, and the table brims with abundance. The clear focus on the extra, unnecessary fork brings the idiom’s meaning into sharp relief."
Images/3262.png,সেয়ানে সেয়ানে কোলা কুলি,Smart people carry bananas on their shoulders.,seyane seyane kola kuli,Even clever people can do foolish or unnecessary things.,"This Bengali idiom সেয়ানে সেয়ানে কোলা কুলি (seyane seyane kola kuli) means that when clever or cunning people interact, they tend to form quick and often opportunistic alliances or partnerships—much like monkeys who easily huddle together for comfort or gain. It is often used to refer to situations where two equally shrewd or manipulative individuals, recognizing each other's nature, join forces for mutual benefit, sometimes with questionable motives or results. The idiom typically suggests a blend of cleverness, opportunistic behavior, and a kindred spirit among those who are sharp or calculating.
For a visual representation, imagine a lively village scene beneath a sprawling banyan tree, where two crafty-looking monkeys perch side by side, arms draped around each other’s shoulders, exchanging sly glances as they eye a pile of ripe bananas. Each monkey keeps one eye on the bananas and the other on its companion, ready to collaborate or compete as circumstances demand. Nearby, villagers notice the duo’s antics, some smirking knowingly, while less astute animals play innocently in the background, unaware of the monkeys’ clever maneuverings. The scene is filled with a sense of strategic alliance, playful wariness, and mutual calculation, vividly bringing to life the idiom's meaning about the alliance of like-minded, sharp-witted individuals"
Images/3263.png,ডাকে দেয়া বর্ষে না।,"Not all who call, rain.",Dake deya borshe na,Not all threats become reality.,"This Bengali idiom ডাকে দেয়া বর্ষে না। means just because the clouds thunder doesn’t mean it will rain—big words or looming threats do not always yield actual results. Used to warn: don’t take all bluster or promises at face value. For the image, picture a wide field under a dramatic sky where dark clouds loom, swirling with noise and lightning in the distance. Farmers wait, anxiously shielding seedlings with straw, but only a few drops fall, and the land remains parched. Some farmers look up in frustration, understanding that the uproar was just sound and fury, signifying little—perfectly capturing the idiom’s message."
Images/3264.png,"ডানার পরে মরণ, গাছের আগায়।","Death after wings, at the top of the tree.","Danar pore moron, gachher agay",Success can bring downfall.,"This Bengali idiom ডানার পরে মরণ, গাছের আগায়। means “death comes to a bird just after it gets its wings, and to a tree when it reaches its top”—signifying abrupt loss just as potential or success is reached, or how achievements sometimes precede downfall. For a poignant scene, imagine a young bird perched proudly at the edge of its nest, wings freshly feathered, about to take its first flight—while ominous dark clouds gather and a hunting falcon circles overhead. Nearby, a flourishing sapling, having just reached the treetop in the clearing, is struck by a sudden bolt of lightning. The duality of hope and disaster is presented with sharp contrasts—promise shadowed by threat—visually embodying the ephemeral nature of success, as highlighted by the idiom."
Images/3265.png,চিৎকার গুড় গুড়।,"Loud shouting, but only murmurs.",Chitkar gur gur,"All talk, no action.","This Bengali idiom চিৎকার গুড় গুড়। means someone makes a loud fuss or yells continuously, but the substance is hollow—lots of noise, little result or value. Think of someone boasting or complaining to no effect. For an image, in a marketplace, a vendor angrily gesticulates and shouts about a minor price dispute, drawing a crowd. People pause, curious, only to lose interest as it becomes clear there’s no real issue—just endless noise. Flies buzz, dust hangs in the air, and as the commotion fizzles, people melt away, leaving the vendor talking to himself, his cries echoing in the emptiness, signifying empty bluster."
Images/3266.png,"হাতে নাই তলোয়ার, নাম ধরা যোদ্ধার।","No sword in hand, but called a warrior.","Hate nai talwar, nam dhora joddhar",Reputation without merit.,"This Bengali idiom হাতে নাই তলোয়ার, নাম ধরা যোদ্ধার। means to be called a warrior without actually possessing a sword—a person claims status or reputation without the means or qualities to back it up. For the visual, imagine a grand village festival where a well-dressed man is introduced as a great warrior; villagers whisper and point towards him. But when a skeptical youth asks for a demonstration, the man only fumbles with a wooden stick, his embarrassment clear. The background is filled with real warriors practicing with sparkly swords and shields, while the ‘warrior’ desperately tries to keep up the facade amid knowing glances and suppressed laughter, evoking the emptiness of titles without substance."
Images/3267.png,"রোমাল হাড়ে থাকলে, সিংহেও বাঘ বরণ করে।","If the handkerchief is on the bone, even a lion fears a tiger.","Romal hare thakle, shingheo bagh boron kore",Even the strong fear the truly dangerous.,"This Bengali idiom রোমাল হাড়ে থাকলে, সিংহেও বাঘ বরণ করে। means that when there is a great benefit or lure involved, even staunch rivals or enemies (here, the lion and the tiger) will come together or respect each other for the sake of that prize. Essentially, self-interest can lead to unlikely alliances or mutual respect where none would exist otherwise. This is typically used when two powerful people or rival parties suddenly cooperate when there is something mutually profitable at stake. For example, if two business competitors collaborate because a big contract is on offer, this idiom can be applied.
For a detailed image, visualize a dense, ancient forest where a single large bone, wrapped in a colorful handkerchief, lies on a raised, sun-lit rock. From one side, a fierce lion, with golden mane shimmering in filtered sunlight, approaches cautiously. From the opposite side, a majestic tiger creeps forward, muscles tense but movement graceful. Both powerful beasts pause, their eyes not just on the bone, but also on each other—each wary, yet respectful. The jungle around falls eerily silent. Birds freeze, deer peer from behind trees, as natural rivals halt their aggression for the moment, drawn together by the promise of a shared prize. The striking tension, the air of uneasy truce, and the shared desire forming the centerpiece of the scene all illustrate how benefit can make even adversaries greet each other with respectful acknowledgment.
"
Images/3268.png,তাড়াহুড়োয় কাজ শয়তানের।,Work in haste is the devil’s.,Tarahuroy kaj shoytaner,Haste makes waste.,"This Bengali idiom তাড়াহুড়োয় কাজ শয়তানের। means that work done in haste or a hurry is often prone to mistakes, failures, or poor outcomes—essentially, “haste makes waste.” This expression is typically used to warn someone against rushing important tasks or when someone experiences negative consequences due to being overly hurried. For example, if a student quickly completes an assignment just before the deadline and ends up making numerous mistakes, this idiom would be aptly applied. For a detailed image, envision a stormy afternoon in a rural village where a young man races against time to fix his collapsing mud hut roof before heavy rain sets in. In his panic and rush, he knocks down several support beams, mud splatters everywhere, and he fumbles with his tools. Neighbors look on from under their umbrellas, some shaking their heads in sympathy. As the first drops of rain start to fall, a gust of wind tears away part of the poorly repaired roof, and water begins to pour inside. The muddied, chaotic scene, marked by the man's frantic movements and worried expression, brings the idiom to life—showing how rushing only leads to greater difficulty."
Images/3269.png,"পুকুর নাম, ঘড়ি ডুববে না।","Enter the pond, but the watch won’t drown.","Pukur nam, ghori dubbe na",Take risks but protect what’s valuable.,"This Bengali idiom পুকুর নাম, ঘড়ি ডুববে না। means that calling something by an impressive name doesn’t change its actual nature or value; putting on a façade doesn’t alter reality. It is typically used to mock situations where people inflate the importance of something minor or dress up something ordinary to give it greater significance. For example, if someone boasts about a tiny ditch by calling it a ‘lake’, this expression is a fitting commentary. For a detailed image, picture a dusty village field where a small, shallow puddle sits under a makeshift sign boldly labeled “Pond.” A group of amused children dare each other to drop toys or a watch into the puddle, but every object just rests visibly in the meager water, unable to sink beneath the surface. Adults standing nearby exchange ironic smiles, while ducks circle the puddle only to waddle away, unimpressed. The laughter, the grandiose sign, and the visible inadequacy of the puddle underscore the idiom’s central idea that appearance or name cannot override true substance."
Images/3270.png,"মুখে কুলুপ, পেটে কুমির।","Lock on the mouth, crocodile in the stomach.","Mukhe kulup, pete kumir",Silent but filled with anger or secrets.,"This Bengali idiom মুখে কুলুপ, পেটে কুমির। means that a person may present a calm, silent exterior while harboring intense emotions, resentment, secrets, or turmoil inside—foreshadowing the dangers of suppressed feelings. It is typically used to describe someone who never voices their true feelings yet is tormented within, or someone quietly plotting. If you observe someone sitting quietly at a family event, seemingly uninvolved, but later discover they were deeply troubled or upset, this idiom captures the situation well. For a detailed image, imagine the hectic atmosphere of a large family gathering. In the corner, a woman sits apart from the crowd, her lips locked tight as if sealed with a golden padlock. Yet, beneath her calm exterior, an x-ray-like vision reveals the coiled, restless form of a crocodile in her stomach, jaws wide in silent anguish. Her face shows composure, but her clenched fists and sideways glances betray tension. Around her, relatives chatter and laugh, some exchanging knowing looks that hint at an awareness of her hidden distress. The scene, marked by the contrast between silence above and turmoil within, clearly illustrates the real meaning of the idiom."
Images/3271.png,রঙে কালি লাগলেই ব্রাহ্মণ হয় না।,Putting ink on doesn’t make one a Brahmin.,Ronge kali laglei brahman hoy na,Outward appearance doesn’t change true nature.,"This Bengali idiom রঙে কালি লাগলেই ব্রাহ্মণ হয় না। means that adopting external appearances, symbols, or rituals does not guarantee genuine inner transformation or virtue; one cannot become truly elevated or learned simply by picking up the outward marks of a Brahmin. It is typically used to expose pretenders and warn against superficiality—like someone putting on a lab coat and claiming to be a doctor. For a detailed image, imagine a traditional riverside ceremony where true Brahmin priests sit in a serene row, their faces peaceful, robes worn and dignified. Next to them, a newcomer tries to blend in by smearing extra color and ink on his body, his garments conspicuously clean and new. Yet, his uneasy staring, awkward posture, and overdone decorations make him stand out sharply from the calm composure of the elders. Villagers nearby exchange smirks, some whispering. The genuine priests focus on their rituals, completely at ease, while the pretender fidgets, casting nervous looks for approval he never receives. The difference in presence and authenticity between the two groups elucidates the idiom’s core warning against judging or transforming oneself by mere appearance.
"
Images/3272.png,রসুনে পাহাড়।,Garlic on a mountain.,Rosune pahar,Something insignificant in a big place.,"This Bengali idiom রসুনে পাহাড়। means exaggerating a small matter into something very large or significant—like making a mountain out of a molehill, or “from garlic, a mountain.” It is commonly applied when someone blows trivial issues out of proportion, creating unnecessary drama or conflict. For example, if a small household disagreement escalates into a family feud, this idiom describes the situation. For a detailed image, envision a modest kitchen where two family members, perhaps a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, quarrel over the use of a single clove of garlic in a curry. In the heat of the moment, the background of the illustration transforms that lone clove into a towering mountain that looms over the household, throwing everything into chaos. Children gape in wonder, elders shake their heads, and neighbors peer through the open window, drawn by the commotion. The perspective exaggerates the garlic’s scale against the ordinary scene, effectively capturing the disproportionate attention and turmoil given to a trivial item."
Images/3273.png,"ভাগ্যের রং, কপালের রং।","Color of fortune, color of the forehead.","Bhagyer rong, kopaler rong",Luck is unpredictable.,"This Bengali idiom ভাগ্যের রং, কপালের রং। means that the outcome of fate or luck is unpredictable and ever-changing—just like colors can be bright or dark. It is often used when talking about unexpected twists in fortune, such as sudden success or setback, or to counsel someone that nobody can truly predict or control destiny. For instance, when someone bounces back after hardship, this idiom offers insight into life’s ups and downs. For a detailed image, imagine an energetic village fair, pulsing with music and color. At its center stands a dazzling giant wheel of fortune, painted with a rainbow of hues—gold, green, blue, red, and black. Villagers take turns spinning the wheel, each hope-filled. Expressions change according to where the needle lands—some jump with excitement, others sigh in disappointment, and a few simply smile, taking life’s changing colors in stride. Balloons float overhead, fireworks pop, and confetti rains down, visually echoing the vibrant, whimsical uncertainty of fate itself.
"
Images/3274.png,মাথায় তেল দিয়ে তেল দেয়া।,Oiling the oiled head.,Mathay tel diye tel deya,Giving more to those who already have.,"This Bengali idiom মাথায় তেল দিয়ে তেল দেয়া। means that repeating an action unnecessarily or overdoing something that’s already been done is pointless and redundant—literally, ‘applying oil on an already oiled head.’ It’s usually used when someone insists on adding more of what is already sufficient, or keeps giving the same advice or effort when it’s clearly no longer needed. For instance, if you keep telling someone to prepare for an exam after they’re already fully prepared, this idiom would apply. For a detailed image, picture a young boy sitting on a traditional wooden stool in a busy household, his hair slick and dripping with coconut oil. Despite his evident discomfort and the obvious shine on his scalp, his well-meaning grandmother, with a focused frown, pours yet another handful of oil over his head while siblings watch in stifled giggles. The mother looks on with a tired smile, knowing the excess. Every splash and drop accentuates the comic futility of unnecessary repetition, visually reinforcing the idiom’s wisdom."
Images/3275.png,তোমার ইচ্ছা পূরণের জন্য নিজেকে উপযুক্ত করো।,Make yourself worthy to fulfill your wish.,Tomar ichchha puroner jonno nije ke upojukto koro,Prepare yourself for your goals.,"This Bengali idiom তোমার ইচ্ছা পূরণের জন্য নিজেকে উপযুক্ত করো। means that to truly fulfill your wishes or achieve your dreams, you must work to make yourself worthy and capable—wishing alone is not enough. It encourages personal growth, preparation, and self-improvement to transform aspirations into reality. It's often used to motivate someone who is dreaming big but not taking meaningful steps towards those goals. For a visual depiction, imagine a young woman standing at the threshold of her modest home, gazing across a wide flowing river towards a grand, sunlit city. In the next scene, she’s shown working diligently—studying late by the glow of a kerosene lamp, practicing public speaking in front of the mirror, and learning new skills. Eventually, she’s seen confidently crossing a sturdy bridge she built herself, her earlier hesitation replaced by determination. Her transformation and the incremental progress depicted in each step provide a vibrant illustration of the idiom’s core message: actively preparing and developing oneself is what makes dreams reachable."
Images/3276.png,তোষামোদ বোকা মজ।,Flattery makes fools happy.,Toshomod boka moj,Fools are pleased by flattery.,"This Bengali idiom তোষামোদ বোকা মজ। means that only a fool is delighted by flattery; wise people aren’t swayed by empty or exaggerated praise. It’s used to caution against naïveté and the dangers of believing insincere compliments, which can lead to embarrassment or trickery. If someone falls for a dishonest person just because of sweet words, this idiom fits perfectly. For an image, envision a lively village market where a sly merchant with a golden tongue showers a simple villager with high praise, calling him ‘the wisest of all.’ The villager, beaming with self-satisfaction, doesn’t notice the merchant quietly padding his basket with cheap, useless items instead of real goods. Meanwhile, others smirk or hide laughter behind their hands, recognizing the ruse. The blend of naive joy and sharp cunning, plus the subtle exchanges among the crowd, all highlight how only the foolish are taken in by flattery, giving the idiom vivid meaning."
Images/3277.png,যেজে দুজনে সঙ্গী নেই।,Both have no companion.,Jeje dujone shongi nei,Lonely people find company in each other.,"This Bengali idiom যেজে দুজনে সঙ্গী নেই। means that two people, both isolated or left out, end up becoming companions out of necessity or shared solitude. This phrase is typically said about social outcasts or those on the margins who bond because they have no one else. For example, if two unpopular classmates partner up because no one else chose them, this idiom applies. For a detailed scene, picture a quiet riverside at dusk: two solitary figures, each sitting alone, eventually wander towards the same spot under a sprawling banyan tree. They begin to talk, hesitantly at first, then find comfort in shared company. Around them, groups of friends play and talk, but these two form their own small, meaningful connection. The surrounding silence, gentle ripples in the water, and the faint golden light all create a mood of shared loneliness that gently grows into companionship—visually emphasizing the idiom’s significance."
Images/3278.png,দম দম ফি ফি।,"Puff puff, hiss hiss.",Dom dom fi fi,"All noise, no substance.","This Bengali idiom দম দম ফি ফি। means a place or situation is full of constant, vibrant activity, noise, and movement—like the bustling heart of a festival or market. It’s used to describe environments brimming with life, excitement, and continuous commotion. For instance, a busy marketplace during festivities is often described this way. For a detailed image, envision a crowded bazaar lane bursting with colors and sounds: vendors call out deals, drums beat rhythmically, children laugh and weave between the stalls, and women in bright sarees negotiate with shopkeepers. Street performers juggle, musicians play flutes, and the entire scene pulses with energy. Dust swirls beneath countless footsteps, and flags flutter overhead, creating a living, breathing tapestry of noise and joy—anchoring the idiom’s essence in every detail."
Images/3279.png,দশ কর্মে ব্যস্ত।,Busy with ten tasks.,Dosh korme byasto,Overwhelmed with too many things.,"This Bengali idiom দশ কর্মে ব্যস্ত। means someone is busy with ten different tasks simultaneously—multitasking to the point of frenzy. It’s used for people, often homemakers or highly energetic workers, seamlessly juggling many responsibilities at once. For example, a mother running an entire household while managing a job fits this idiom. For a detailed visual, imagine a woman in her home surrounded by chaos: she’s cooking, answering the phone, helping one child with homework, another with a scraped knee, folding laundry with her foot, while keeping an eye on boiling milk to prevent overflow. Tools and toys litter the scene, family members buzz in and out, yet her face reflects focus and the art of keeping everything (barely) under control. The layers of activity, overlapping sounds, and visible signs of organized chaos fully capture the idiom’s spirit."
Images/3280.png,দশ চোরে ভগবান ভুতে।,"Among ten thieves, God is a ghost.",Dosh chore bhogoban bhute,"In bad company, good is lost.","This Bengali idiom দশ চোরে ভগবান ভুতে। means that in a place full of wrongdoers or thieves, someone virtuous or honest is seen as an oddity—or even met with suspicion or mockery. The literal translation is “among ten thieves, God is mistaken for a ghost,” meaning that goodness can be misunderstood or rejected when everyone else is corrupt. It’s used when virtue is so rare in a context that it becomes alien or suspect. For a detailed image, envision a dimly-lit alley where a group of crooks gather under cover of darkness. Suddenly, a saintly figure robed in white passes by, radiant and serene. Instead of admiration, the thieves shrink back in fear, whispering among themselves as if they've seen a ghost. Some regard him with open disbelief, others nudge each other nervously, highlighting how honesty becomes alien in a world of deceit. The stark contrast between the holy man’s calm and the thieves’ panic visually reinforces the idiom’s moral."
Images/3281.png,"দরকারে মরে করে কাজ, হাজারে মরে নারাজ।","Willing to die for need, unwilling for a thousand.","Dorkare more kore kaj, hazare more naraj",People act only when needed.,"This Bengali idiom দরকারে মরে করে কাজ, হাজারে মরে নারাজ। means that when it’s truly necessary, people will go to any extent and show great effort—even risking themselves—but when asked to do something a thousand times without a compelling need, they strongly resist. It highlights human nature: genuine necessities or crises provoke action, but people avoid effort when urgency is lacking. This idiom is often used when someone unexpectedly acts resourceful or courageous in danger but is uncooperative or apathetic in everyday situations. For an image, visualize a village river in flood, with a young man heroically plunging in to save a drowning child, full of determination and courage—onlookers gasp and point. In the next scene, the same man is seen lazily ignoring routine community chores or pretending to be asleep when called for mundane work. The contrast between dramatic urgency and inert reluctance is sharply drawn, visually reinforcing how need drives people to extraordinary action, while abundance or routine saps their enthusiasm."
Images/3282.png,দরকারি ধরি এরকরে বাজা।,"Hold on to what’s needed, leave the rest.",Dorkari dhori er kore baja,Focus on what’s necessary.,"This Bengali idiom দরকারি ধরি এরকরে বাজা। means that people only show affection or keep relationships alive when there’s a benefit, and otherwise, the bonds are hollow or insincere. It is used to expose opportunistic friendships or alliances that survive only as long as they are useful. For example, when someone is only friendly or loyal when they need something, this idiom is apt. For a detailed image, imagine a person praised lavishly and surrounded by well-wishers at a time of prosperity—people hand over gifts and crowd close, all smiles. Later, as fortunes fade, the same person stands alone, the previous “friends” now distant or turning away coldly. The stark change between crowded adulation and lonely isolation, with body language and expressions emphasizing opportunism, makes the meaning of the idiom visually vivid and emotionally resonant."
Images/3283.png,"দরিদ্রের আহার খুঁজে, ধনীর খুঁজে ক্ষুধা।","The poor search for food, the rich for appetite.","Doridrer ahar khuje, dhonir khuje khudha",The rich and poor have different problems.,"This Bengali idiom দরিদ্রের আহার খুঁজে, ধনীর খুঁজে ক্ষুধা। means that poor people seek food, but the wealthy look for hunger. It highlights the stark difference in the lives of rich and poor: for the poor, food is a basic survival need; for the rich, abundance is such that they crave appetite or desire itself. The idiom is often used when reflecting on social inequality or to admonish those who take their privileges for granted. For a complete image, picture a humble family around a small clay stove, parents anxiously watching a pot in hopes of enough for everyone. In contrast, a rich household’s ornate dining table groans with delicacies, but an elegantly dressed man sighs in boredom, barely touching his lavish meal. The juxtaposition of hunger versus too much choice, depicted through posture and facial expression, elegantly brings the idiom’s message to life."
Images/3284.png,দামে থাকলে দামের মজা নাই।,"If it’s priced, there’s no fun in the price.",Dame thakle damer moja nai,Things are valued more when rare.,"This Bengali idiom দামে থাকলে দামের মজা নাই। means that when something is easily available or abundant, it loses its value or appeal—true worth is felt only in scarcity. It’s typically used to explain why people fail to appreciate what they already have in abundance. For example, when children don’t value toys until they’re broken or missing, this idiom is apt. For a detailed image, show a child surrounded by dozens of glimmering toys, none of which brings joy as he stares off in boredom. In contrast, another scene shows a single well-loved toy cherished and clutched tightly. The piles of ignored objects, contrasted with the delight over a rare possession, visually express that the allure of value comes from rarity, not abundance."
Images/3285.png,দামে নাই কুকুরের বাঘা নাম।,Dog’s big name is worthless.,Dame nai kukurer bagha nam,Empty reputation is useless.,"This Bengali idiom দামে নাই কুকুরের বাঘা নাম। means that a dog may have a ferocious or grand name like “Tiger,” but the name alone does not confer real value or power. The idiom comments on the emptiness of grand labels without substance, power, or merit behind them. It’s typically used when someone tries to overstate their credentials or status through titles. For a vivid image, imagine a small, scrawny dog prancing proudly through the village, a gold tag reading “Sheru the Tiger” around its neck. Villagers chuckle as it barks harmlessly at passing cows, clearly not living up to its bold name. The contrast between the boastful tag and the dog’s true timidity underlines how names mean little without substance."
Images/3286.png,"রোদ থাকলে বারধা, বৃষ্টি হলে বহু দুঃখ।","Sunshine brings joy, rain brings sorrow.","Rod thakle bardha, brishti hole bahu dukh",Good times are followed by bad.,"This Bengali idiom রোদ থাকলে বারধা, বৃষ্টি হলে বহু দুঃখ। means that when the sun shines it’s too hot to work, but when it rains, people complain of too many troubles—in effect, people are never satisfied, always finding something to grumble about regardless of conditions. It’s used to humorously point out a tendency toward constant dissatisfaction. In a village paddy field, during a scorching sunny day, farmers stand under umbrellas, mopping their brows and whining about the heat. When rain pours down, the same farmers, now in muddy puddles, grumble about slipping and ruined crops. The juxtaposition, highlighted by expressions of discomfort and comic exasperation in both weather extremes, illustrates the universality of human complaint"
Images/3287.png,দিঘির জলে সময় নষ্ট।,Wasting time in the pond’s water.,Dighir jole shomoy noshto,Wasting time uselessly.,"This Bengali idiom দিঘির জলে সময় নষ্ট। means wasting time or effort on something endless or unproductive, likened to stirring or searching in a vast pond where one gains nothing. It’s used to describe futile pursuits or efforts with little hope of reward. For a complete image, imagine a man standing waist-deep in a huge, tranquil pond from dawn till dusk, endlessly scooping water with a bucket, accomplishing nothing as the pond is refilled by countless streams. Ducks and fish swim by, ignoring his struggle. Meanwhile, on the bank, elders shake their heads, muttering that he’s wasting both time and energy. The sense of fruitless action and lingering futility is made vivid through the monotony of motion and the unchanging panorama of water."
Images/3288.png,"দুই জনে বন্ধুত্ব হয়, তিন জনে কেহ হয় না।","Friendship is between two, not three.","Dui jone bondhutto hoy, tin jone keu hoy na",Too many people spoil a friendship.,"This Bengali idiom দুই জনে বন্ধুত্ব হয়, তিন জনে কেহ হয় না। means that deep friendship typically thrives best between two people; when a third is involved, the closeness or trust can diminish, leading to misunderstandings or split loyalties. It’s especially used when a tight bond weakens or turns complicated with the arrival of another person—a classic observation in workplace, school, or social circles. For an evocative scene, imagine two friends walking side by side down a sunlit village path, talking closely and sharing laughter. The next scene, as a third joins, shows subtle tension: one looks left out, conversation falters, and smiles fade. The once-perfect harmony is now marked by uncertainty, visually capturing the idiom’s warning about the fragility of close bonds in a trio."
Images/3289.png,"দুই স্ত্রী যার, বড় দুঃখ তার।",He who has two wives has great sorrow.,"Dui stri jar, boro dukh tar",Divided loyalties bring trouble.,"This Bengali idiom দুই স্ত্রী যার, বড় দুঃখ তার। means ‘he who has two wives has great sorrow,’ referring to the difficulties, complications, and misery that come from trying to please two people equally in delicate personal situations. Though rooted in historical polygamy, it is broadly applied whenever someone tries to divide loyalty between competing interests and ends up unhappy. For a detailed image, picture a weary man sitting anxiously in the courtyard of his house, caught between two wives who are turned away from each other, arms crossed in anger. Both cast piercing glances at him, and children peek from behind columns, sensing the tension. The air is thick with conflict, misunderstandings, and the impossibility of peace—depicted through the man’s helplessness and the brooding mood, the idiom’s message is clearly visualized."
Images/3290.png,দুঃখ না পেলে সুখের মজা বোঝা যায় না।,"Without sorrow, joy is not understood.",Dukh na pele sukher moja bojha jay na,Suffering makes us appreciate happiness.,"This Bengali idiom দুঃখ না পেলে সুখের মজা বোঝা যায় না। means that unless you have experienced sorrow, you cannot truly appreciate happiness. It’s a reminder that life’s joys become meaningful only when contrasted with trials and grief. This idiom is often used to provide comfort or perspective to someone going through a hard time, suggesting that these feelings are part of a larger balance. For a rich illustration, picture a narrative split into two halves: on one side, a person sits in the rain, shoulders hunched, surrounded by shadows; on the other, the same person stands beneath a rainbow, smiling radiantly amidst friends and sunlight. The change in posture, color, and expression from gloom to joy makes vivid the contrast—and the idiom’s reassuring wisdom that good times feel sweeter when you have known sorrow."
Images/3291.png,দুঃখের পরে সুখ।,After sorrow comes happiness.,Dukher pore shukh,Good times follow bad.,"This Bengali idiom দুঃখের পরে সুখ। means that happiness and relief often come after a period of sorrow or hardship—a universal truth reflecting life’s perennial cycle. It serves as reassurance, comforting those who are suffering that better times will inevitably follow. People use it to console others during adversity or after personal failures, loss, or despair, reminding them that difficult phases are transient.
Visualize: Imagine a two-part scene set in a modest rural home. In the first scene, a family sits huddled in a dimly lit room during a fierce monsoon storm—the father’s shoulders are heavy, the mother gently consoles their shivering children, rain battering the roof, and anxiety etched into every face. The house feels cramped and sombre, and time seems to move slowly amid the hardship. Now, as the sun rises days later, the same family emerges onto their doorstep: golden morning light floods the yard, the air is crisp and clear, and they joyously embrace one another. Children jump in puddles, neighbors gather to help rebuild, and there is the unmistakable energy of hope on every face. The garden, once battered, now shows new blossoms—every detail highlighting the uplifting transition from despair to happiness, and the lesson that suffering can pave the way for brighter days."
Images/3292.png,দুধে কোবরা পোষা।,Rearing a cobra in milk.,Dudhe kobra posha,Helping the ungrateful is dangerous.,"This Bengali idiom দুধে কোবরা পোষা। means ""rearing a cobra in milk"": supporting, nurturing, or showing generous kindness to someone unworthy, dangerous, or ungrateful, thereby inviting harm upon oneself. It is commonly said when people’s generosity leads to betrayal or unintended consequences, such as supporting a harmful family member or assisting a friend who later becomes an adversary.
Visualize: In a family’s sacred altar room, an elderly woman gently pours a brass bowl of fresh, creamy milk onto a small tray, placing it in front of a woven basket. As steam rises, a large cobra with mesmerizing patterns glides out and drinks, its unblinking eyes focused on the worshippers, tongue flicking menacingly. The family stands respectfully but uneasily—children peeking around their mother’s sari, the father’s smile brittle and uncertain. On the wall behind, a shadow stretches tall and ominous—suggesting that this act of care, meant as an offering or gesture of goodwill, harbors great danger. The room’s contrast between ritual calm and lurking peril, the juxtaposition of purity and threat, and the tension on each face all make the idiom’s warning unforgettable: kindness shown to the ungrateful or malevolent can turn against the giver."
Images/3293.png,দুর্দশায় অনেকে স্থানে সৌভাগ্যের মূল।,Misery is the root of fortune in many places.,Durdoshay oneke sthane shoubhagyer mul,Adversity can lead to fortune.,"This Bengali idiom দুর্দশায় অনেকে স্থানে সৌভাগ্যের মূল। means that misfortune and hardship are often the roots of future prosperity or happiness; what seems like a setback can lay foundations for later success. It offers hope in adversity and is typically spoken to encourage resilience, perspective, or acceptance when life is at its bleakest.
Visualize: On a parched field, cracked earth under a scorching midday sun, a lone, weary farmer kneels, his face streaked with sweat and tears. He gazes down at weather-withered seeds pressed into the soil—failures of previous seasons weighing heavy on his shoulders. In the distant background, small tufts of green bravely burst through the cracks, hinting at hidden potential. Fast forward: a lush, vibrant orchard now flourishes from those very seeds, families and neighbors laughing while harvesting an abundant crop. The image swells with movement and color—lush fruit glistening, children running between the trees, old hands plucking harvest with pride. Every detail speaks to life's unpredictability—the prior struggle is not erased but embedded in the new bounty, turning suffering into fortune."
Images/3294.png,দুষ্ট গরুর চেয়ে শুন্য গোয়াল ভালো।,Better an empty cowshed than a wicked cow.,Dushto gorur cheye shunyo goyal bhalo,Better to have nothing than bad company.,"This Bengali idiom দুষ্ট গরুর চেয়ে শুন্য গোয়াল ভালো। translates to “an empty cowshed is better than a bad cow.” It is a warning that sometimes it is preferable to have nothing than to deal with the constant trouble or harm that comes with a problematic presence, whether a person, partnership, or situation. Used when someone lets go of toxic relationships or problematic possessions for the sake of peace.
Visualize: A once-chaotic cowshed sits empty except for fresh straw and beams of sunlight streaming through the open doorway. Scratches and splinters on the walls hint at past turmoil. Peering out into a lush, tranquil field, the farm owner finally gets a peaceful night’s sleep, his face relaxed for the first time in seasons. In the distance, the “bad cow” forlornly kicks up dust, facing away from the farm’s warmth. The serenity inside, punctuated by birds nesting in the beams and flowers peeking through the cracks, communicates relief and newfound harmony previously unattainable—vividly demonstrating the idiom’s message."
Images/3295.png,দূরের পাহাড় নীল মনে হয়।,Distant hills look blue.,Durer pahar nil mone hoy,Things seem better from afar.,"This Bengali idiom দূরের পাহাড় নীল মনে হয়। means “the far-off hills appear blue”: distant or unattainable things inevitably seem more alluring and beautiful than what’s familiar or accessible. It describes longing, romantic ideals, or the human tendency to overvalue what’s out of reach.
Visualize: A dreamy village boy sits on a grassy knoll at sunset, gazing far across emerald rice fields and winding rivers at a mountain range bathed in azure haze. His mind fills with grand fantasies—perhaps of adventure, treasure, or a new life. Around him, daily village life unfolds: a shepherd calls to his flock, women draw water from a well, friends play nearby—but his gaze never leaves the horizon. Meanwhile, the “blue mountains” shimmer with an ethereal light, clouds dancing over them, making them seem magical. The foreground’s earthy bustle contrasts with the distant, idealized beauty of the peaks, dramatizing the idiom’s wisdom about distant allure and the blindness it can bring to nearby treasures."
Images/3296.png,দেওয়ালেরও কান আছে।,Even walls have ears.,Dewaler-o kan ache,"Be careful, someone may be listening.","This Bengali idiom দেওয়ালেরও কান আছে। means “even the walls have ears.” It cautions that secrets or careless talk may be overheard, intentionally or by accident, and that discretion is essential, especially when discussing sensitive topics at home, in public, or at work. Often invoked to signal caution in gossip or politicking.
Visualize: Two women huddle over their cups of tea in a moonlit clay courtyard, voices low but eyes darting. Around them, the mud house walls bulge ever slightly, as if listening intently—faces and ears subtly outlined in the surface, making ordinary plaster seem conspiratorial. Shadows outside hint at children eavesdropping beneath window ledges and a neighbor pausing in her chores, straining to catch a snippet. Every gesture, from hesitancy in their posture to a wary glance over the shoulder, amplifies the tension—making privacy feel uncertain, and the idiom’s lesson about hidden listeners extremely concrete."
Images/3297.png,দেখেশুনে পা বাড়াও।,Step forward after seeing.,Dekhe shune pa baraw,Think before you act.,"This Bengali idiom দেখেশুনে পা বাড়াও। means “step carefully after looking”—advising thoughtful consideration and caution before taking action or making decisions. It’s commonly used as prudent advice to young adults starting something new or anyone faced with risky or uncertain ventures.
Visualize: On the edge of a dense forest, a traveler stands pausing at the fork of a rocky trail. The ground is dappled with tricky stones, patches of slippery moss, and misleading footprints from animals. Nearby, a wise elder gestures towards a safe path, his finger drawing attention to hidden pitfalls and an easier route that curves through sunlit clearings. The cautious traveler shields his eyes from the sun, assessing every footstep, while other, less careful villagers in the distance can be seen picking their way through unseen puddles or stumbling into brambles. The intensity of his focus and the subtle hints of danger around him drive home the value of careful observation before big steps."
Images/3298.png,দোষী নিজেই নিজের সাক্ষী।,The guilty is his own witness.,Doshi nijei nijer shakshi,One’s actions reveal the truth.,"This Bengali idiom দোষী নিজেই নিজের সাক্ষী। literally “the guilty is their own witness,” means those who commit wrongdoing often betray themselves through actions, words, or evidence they leave behind—guilt reveals itself without external accusations. Used when someone's behavior or possessions give them away, though they deny their misdeeds.
Visualize: At a crowded village festival, a little boy stands center stage after loudly denying he stole a sweetmeat. Yet, sugar dust glitters on his lips and sticky fingers, and a crumpled candy wrapper lies underneath his loose shirt. Adults raise eyebrows and friends snicker. The boy’s eyes dart nervously, posture tight as he tries to stand tall, but a trail of evidence literally and figuratively leads straight to him. The humor, embarrassment, and the always-present “trace” of guilt visually interpret the idiom’s message."
Images/3299.png,ধর্মের কাজ আপন বরজ।,Religious work is for one’s own field.,Dhormer kaj apon boroj,Mind your own business.,"This Bengali idiom ধর্মের কাজ আপন বরজ। means “good deeds are for one's own soul”—religious observance or virtuous acts are personally enriching, important whether or not anyone else sees or appreciates them. It teaches that spiritual or ethical actions must come from inner conviction rather than the desire for external reward or show.
Visualize: Early dawn finds an elderly man praying quietly in a dew-laden garden, utterly alone and serene. A faint glow surrounds him as he lights incense and murmurs a blessing, eyes closed in genuine absorption. In contrast, further off, a crowd gathers in a temple courtyard, many more animated by being seen than by faith itself. The man’s tranquil solitude—sunrise filtering through treetops, his gentle smile, the hush of birds—amplifies the idea that faith is a private, inward journey, not a public performance."
Images/3300.png,ধরার মাছ না ছুঁই পারন।,Catching fish without touching the water.,Dharar mach na chui paran,Gaining without effort is impossible.,"This Bengali idiom ধরার মাছ না ছুঁই পারন। describes someone wanting every benefit without taking risk or responsibility—the wish to catch a fish from the river without wetting one’s hands. It is used to call out laziness, avoidance of effort, or unrealistic expectations, much like wanting results with no investment.
Visualize: A fisherman perches on a large boulder, fishing rod in hand, eyes anxiously fixed on the water, but his sleeves rolled high and his hands never daring to stray close to the river’s edge. Other fishermen, hip-deep in the current, pull in their nets with hearty laughter, sleeves soaked, faces sunburned but content. In the background, villagers watch the shore-bound fisherman with a mix of amusement and pity. The comic disparity between effort and expectation echoes the idiom’s sharp critique of effort-avoidant opportunism.
"
Images/3301.png,ধান দিয়ে পাখি পড়া শেখা।,Teaching a bird to fall with rice.,Dhan diye pakhi pora shekha,Bribing to get things done.,"This Bengali idiom ধান দিয়ে পাখি পড়া শেখা। means ""teaching a bird to fly by offering paddy"": expending unnecessary resources to achieve something that would happen naturally or is inherently simple. It comments on overcomplicating matters or using excessive means for a basic result. It's commonly used to spotlight wasteful or inefficient behavior.
Visualize: Under the bright mid-morning sun, an earnest old man stands in a field, tossing handfuls of precious rice grain into the air, hoping to entice a flock of birds. The birds, already perfectly capable of flight, swirl happily, dancing just out of reach, never settling long enough for his plan to succeed. Beckoning grandchildren stare, mouths agape, at the clouds of rice vanishing. The elder’s growing frustration, the birds’ mischievous freedom, and the gradually depleting sack of paddy all reflect the folly and gentle humor communicated by the idiom."
Images/3302.png,ধান ভানতে শিবের গীত।,Singing Shiva’s song while threshing rice.,Dhan bhante shiber geet,Mixing unrelated things.,"This Bengali idiom ধান ভানতে শিবের গীত। means bringing up irrelevant topics or getting distracted by side conversations while doing something important—literally, “singing Shiva’s songs while milling rice.” It highlights a tendency to lose focus, digress, or mix unrelated matters with the main task. It’s often used when someone interrupts a discussion with unrelated stories or when a task is derailed by tangents. For example, if a work meeting devolves into unrelated personal anecdotes, this idiom could be applied. For a detailed image, picture a rustic village courtyard at harvest time. In the foreground, several women sit in a circle, rhythmically pounding rice with heavy wooden pestles, puffs of chaff floating in the air. While their hands move automatically with the work, one woman—face animated, hands briefly stilled—launches into a spirited rendition of a Shiva devotional, her companions gradually joining in and forgetting their rhythm. Laughter erupts, and some children, attracted by the singing, pause their play; a neighbor wanders over, drawn by the music. All the while, the pile of unmilled rice grows neglected and chickens gather at its base. The merging of song and work, the distraction amidst purpose, and the gentle chaos of mingled duties—all together, these elements encapsulate the playfully critical spirit of the idiom."
Images/3303.png,"ধার কর, কর নয়, ফাঁড়ি দর।","Borrow, not pay, only trouble.","Dhar kor, kor noy, fadi dor",Borrowing leads to trouble.,"This Bengali idiom, ""ধার করে, কর ফাঁকি দিয়ে, ভেগে যাও"" (Dhar kore, kor fanki diye, bhege jao), means that ""Borrow, don't pay tax, run away."" This idiom means it reflects a cynical or critical mindset that prioritizes avoiding obligations and responsibilities, particularly financial ones, through deceptive or evasive means. It highlights a tendency to incur debts without genuine intention of repayment and to evade duties, suggesting a character that is opportunistic and shirks accountability. It's often used to describe someone who takes advantage of others' generosity or legal loopholes for personal gain without facing consequences.

For a powerful image, envision a shadowy figure deftly slipping through a labyrinth of financial documents and legal notices, leaving behind a trail of IOUs and unpaid bills that dissipate into thin air; this figure holds a full purse, their face obscured, as they glance back with a knowing smirk towards perplexed creditors and tax collectors, symbolizing the act of evading accountability and benefiting from others' generosity without consequence."
Images/3304.png,ন রক্ষি গুহ্যং প্রবিশ্যন্তি মূর্খ মৃগাঃ।,Fools enter where secrets are not guarded.,Na rokshi guhyo probishonti murkh mrigah,Fools rush in where wise men fear to tread.,"ThisBengali idiom, ""মূর্খ হরিণ সুরক্ষিত গুহায় প্রবেশ করে না"" (Murkho Horin Shurokkhito Guhaye Probesh Kore Na), means that ""Foolish deer do not enter a protected cave."" This idiom means even those who are typically considered foolish or unintelligent possess a basic instinct for self-preservation and will avoid obvious dangers or clearly protected areas. It suggests that a fundamental level of caution, even if driven by instinct rather than intellect, prevents beings from walking directly into danger when it is clearly marked or defended. It often carries a sarcastic undertone, implying that if even ""foolish deer"" understand something, then truly intelligent beings should grasp it easily.

For a powerful image, envision a lush, green forest with a clearly marked cave entrance, perhaps with warnings like thorny vines or a faint, menacing glow emanating from within. While other, braver animals might approach cautiously, a visibly naive or simple-minded deer pauses at the threshold, its large eyes wide with an instinctual understanding of danger, turning away from the obvious threat. The scene emphasizes that even without complex thought, basic self-preservation triumphs over recklessness when danger is apparent."
Images/3305.png,নগদ নেন মা ভালে হয়।,"Cash is best, mother says.",Nogod nen ma bhalo hoy,Cash in hand is best.,"This Bengali idiom, ""নগদ ভালো, মা"" (Nogod Bhalo, Ma), means that ""Taking cash is good, mother."" This idiom means it pragmatically advises the importance of dealing in cash or securing immediate, tangible payment for services or goods. It reflects a cautious approach to transactions, implying that relying on promises, credit, or delayed payments often leads to complications, non-payment, or disappointment. It champions the security and straightforwardness of cash transactions, suggesting that immediate payment is the most reliable and trouble-free method, ensuring one's efforts are truly compensated.

For a powerful image, envision a bustling marketplace where two vendors stand side-by-side. One vendor's stall is overflowing with goods, but they look worriedly at a pile of IOUs and empty promises, their face reflecting anxiety. Next to them, another vendor, perhaps with fewer but well-tended goods, smiles contentedly as customers hand them crisp banknotes, which they neatly stack, visually emphasizing the security and peace of mind that comes with immediate, tangible payment over credit or deferred promises."
Images/3306.png,"নুন নতুন, নুন নীতি।","New salt, salt policy.","Noon notun, noon niti",New things bring new rules.,"This Bengali idiom, ""নূতন চাল, নূতন নিয়ম"" (Nuton Chal, Nuton Niyom), means that ""New salt, new rule."" This idiom means with new circumstances, new people, or a change in authority, come new regulations, policies, or ways of doing things. It highlights the adaptable nature of rules and expectations, suggesting that one must adjust to the current regime or prevailing conditions rather than clinging to old norms. It often refers to a situation where the arrival of a fresh power or influence brings a shift in established practices, sometimes for better, sometimes not, but undeniably different.

For a powerful image, envision a grand, old building where a new, vibrant flag is being hoisted, causing the previously rigid pathways to subtly shift and new, modern tools to replace old ones in the hands of the workers, symbolizing how new authority brings new ways."
Images/3307.png,"নদীর এপার কহে ছাড়িয়া নিশ্বাস, ওপারেতে সুখ আমার বিশ্বাস।","This bank sighs, the other bank is happier.","Nodir epar kohe chhariya nishash, opar-e shukh amar bishash",The grass is always greener on the other side.,"This Bengali idiom, ""নদীর এপার কহে ছাড়িয়া নিঃশ্বাস, ওপার সে কহে কিবা সুখের বাস"" (Nodir Epar Kohe Chhariya Nishwash, Opar She Kohe Kiba Sukher Bash), means that ""This side of the river sighs, believing happiness is on the other side."" This idiom means it captures the universal human tendency to perceive happiness, contentment, or a better life as existing elsewhere, beyond one's current circumstances or reach. It expresses a longing for an idealized future or distant reality, often overlooking potential joys or possibilities in the present. It highlights the human inclination to believe that greener pastures always lie across the metaphorical ""river,"" rather than finding peace where one is.

For a powerful image, envision a person standing on one riverbank, gazing longingly across at a seemingly idyllic, brightly lit opposite bank, while unaware of the vibrant, blooming flowers and warm sunlight directly behind them on their own side, perfectly capturing the yearning for distant happiness."
Images/3308.png,"নয় বছরে (বুড়ো) না হলে, নব্বই বছরেও হয় না।","If not old at nine, won’t be at ninety.","Noy bachhore (buro) na hole, nobboi bachhore-o hoy na",Habits form early and rarely change.,"This Bengali idiom, ""নয় বছরে না হলে নব্বইয়েও না"" (Noy Bochore Na Hole Nobboiyeo Na), means that ""If not old (wise) by nine years, one won't be by ninety."" This idiom means it strikingly emphasizes that fundamental character traits, intellectual development, or innate wisdom are often established early in life. It implies that if a person does not show signs of maturity, good judgment, or a particular disposition by a relatively young age, it is highly unlikely they will acquire these qualities even in extreme old age. It speaks to the deep-rooted nature of personality and the difficulty of fundamental change later in life, suggesting that some things are set early on.

For a powerful image, envision a young sapling, firmly rooted and beginning to branch out in a distinct direction, while in the background, a very old, gnarled tree follows the exact same mature pattern as the sapling, visually asserting that early growth dictates later form, no matter the age."
Images/3309.png,না আঁচালে বিশ্বাস নাই।,No trust without the end of the sari.,Na anchale bishash nai,Proof is needed for trust.,"This Bengali idiom, ""শেষ না হওয়া পর্যন্ত বিশ্বাস নেই"" (Shesh Na Howa Porjonto Bisshas Nei), means that ""No trust until it is finished."" This idiom means it expresses a cautious and pragmatic approach to promises, tasks, or ventures, asserting that true certainty or reliability can only be assured once a commitment is fully fulfilled, a task is completed, or an outcome is definitively achieved. It implies skepticism towards mere assurances or halfway measures, promoting the belief that only tangible results or finality can truly validate an agreement or an expectation. It is a cautionary reminder to reserve judgment until the very end.

For a powerful image, envision a partially built bridge, with one side seemingly complete but the other still just a skeletal framework, while a wary traveler stands before it, holding their ground despite assurances, waiting for the final plank to be laid and the two sides to truly connect, symbolizing the need for completion before trust."
Images/3310.png,নাই মামার চেয়ে কানা মামা ভালো।,A one-eyed uncle is better than no uncle.,Nai mamar cheye kana mama bhalo,Something is better than nothing.,"This Bengali idiom, ""এক কানা মামা না থাকার চেয়ে ভালো"" (Ek Kana Mama Na Thakar Cheye Bhalo), means that ""A one-eyed uncle is better than no uncle at all."" This idiom means it pragmatically highlights the idea that having even a flawed, imperfect, or minimally capable resource, connection, or support is preferable to having absolutely none. It suggests that in a situation of dire need, any form of help or presence, no matter how limited or imperfect, is better than complete absence or isolation. It advises making the best of available, even if suboptimal, options.

For a powerful image, envision a desolate landscape where a person is struggling, and a single, slightly bent, but still supportive stick lies on the ground, clearly imperfect but capable of offering just enough aid to keep them moving, emphasizing that even flawed assistance is superior to none."

This idiom means it critiques individuals who, lacking skill, ability, or competence in a task, consistently deflect blame onto external circumstances, tools, or other people rather than acknowledging their own deficiencies. It highlights a common human tendency to find fault elsewhere to cover up personal inadequacy, emphasizing a lack of accountability and an unwillingness to self-reflect on one's shortcomings.

For a powerful image, envision a dancer flailing awkwardly while pointing accusingly at the wavy, uneven lines of the stage floor, completely ignoring their own missteps, symbolizing the act of blaming external factors for one's own lack of skill."
Images/3312.png,নানা মুনির নানা মত।,"Many sages, many opinions.",Nana munir nana mot,Different people have different views.,"This Bengali idiom, ""নানা মুনির নানা মত"" (Nana Munir Nana Mot), means that ""Many sages, many opinions."" This idiom means it elegantly describes a situation where there is a diversity of opinions, conflicting viewpoints, or a lack of consensus among a group of knowledgeable or authoritative individuals. It suggests that even among experts or wise persons, complete agreement is rare, and different perspectives are natural, often leading to varied advice or conclusions on the same subject. It highlights the subjective nature of interpretation and the reality of intellectual disagreement.

For a powerful image, envision a circle of wise, robed figures in a council, each speaking animatedly and holding up different, colorful scrolls, with thought bubbles above their heads showing unique solutions to the same problem, symbolizing the natural divergence of opinions even among experts."

This idiom means it underscores the fundamental human instinct for self-preservation as the ultimate priority, implying that one must first ensure their own survival or well-being before they can uphold any legacy, responsibility, or honor. It suggests that in dire or life-threatening situations, all other considerations become secondary to the imperative of staying alive, as without one's existence, all other values become moot.

For a powerful image, envision a person clinging precariously to a crumbling cliff edge, dropping everything they were carrying to secure their grip, with a faint, ancestral crest glowing momentarily above them before fading as their survival becomes the sole focus."

This idiom means it expresses a philosophical outlook where one's personal disposition, attitude, and moral character significantly shape their perception and experience of the world around them. It suggests that an individual who possesses goodness, integrity, and a positive mindset will tend to view and experience the world as a benevolent and favorable place, implying that our inner state largely determines our outer reality. It champions the power of an individual's virtue to color their entire existence.

This idiom means it powerfully conveys the ultimate subjectivity and self-centricity of individual experience. It means that from one's own perspective, their demise signifies the end of their entire world, as their consciousness and perception of reality cease to exist. It highlights the absolute finality of death for the individual and the profound, personal loss of all experience and existence, emphasizing that for the person experiencing it, their death is indeed the end of everything they know, making their personal world cease to be.

For a powerful image, envision a vibrant, detailed world—cities, nature, people—that slowly fades and dissolves into nothingness, like sand through an hourglass, as a single, central eye closes in the foreground, symbolizing the complete cessation of one's perceived reality upon death."
Images/3316.png,নিজেকে জানো।,Know yourself.,Nije ke jano,Self-awareness is important.,"This Bengali idiom, ""নিজেকে জানো"" (Nijeke Jano), means that ""Know yourself."" This idiom means this philosophical maxim serves as a timeless injunction for self-reflection, introspection, and a deep understanding of one's own character, strengths, weaknesses, motivations, and purpose in life. It suggests that true wisdom, personal growth, and effective action stem from a clear and honest awareness of one's inner self, emphasizing that self-knowledge is the fundamental key to a meaningful and well-directed existence.

This idiom means it pragmatically advises individuals to mind their own business, focus on their own responsibilities, affairs, and work, and refrain from meddling or interfering in the matters of others. It promotes self-reliance and diligence in one's personal domain, suggesting that one should ensure their own ""machine"" (life, work, responsibilities) is well-maintained and functioning before attempting to troubleshoot or involve themselves in others' affairs. It champions the idea of focusing energy where it's most effective and relevant: on oneself.

This idiom means it highlights a pervasive human blind spot: the tendency to be acutely aware of others' shortcomings and mistakes, while remaining oblivious to or minimizing one's own flaws, errors, or negative traits. It underscores human self-deception and the difficulty of objective self-assessment, suggesting that a lack of introspection or an inherent bias makes it challenging for individuals to acknowledge their own imperfections, even when they are obvious to others.

For a powerful image, envision a person holding a large magnifying glass, keenly inspecting the tiny flaws on someone else's shirt, while their own reflection, revealing a large tear on their back, is perfectly visible in a mirror they are standing in front of, symbolizing the human tendency to see others' faults but not their own."

This idiom means it describes an act of self-destructive revenge or spite, where an individual willingly inflicts harm, loss, or disadvantage upon themselves, even severe damage, solely for the purpose of causing trouble, failure, or a minor setback for someone else. It highlights an extreme form of malice driven by envy or resentment, where the desire to hinder another person outweighs any concern for personal well-being or logical self-interest.

For a powerful image, envision a spiteful figure deliberately severing a rope bridge they are standing on, just to prevent someone else from crossing much further down the path, enduring a painful fall themselves purely to cause minor inconvenience to another."

For a powerful image, envision a person diligently chopping wood, but with each swing, the axe head glances off the log and strikes their own foot, illustrating a repeated, self-inflicted wound caused by their own actions or poor judgment."

This idiom means it describes the act of self-adulation, where an individual boasts about their own achievements, qualities, or virtues.

The idiom typically carries a slightly negative or critical connotation, implying a lack of humility and a self-centered perspective that can be off-putting to others.

For a powerful image, envision a person standing alone on a stage, enthusiastically beating a drum emblazoned with their own face, while an audience of unimpressed, averted faces watches, symbolizing the act of self-praise that often fails to impress others."
Images/3322.png,"নিজের শাবার খাই নেই, শংকরাচার্য কুকুর রাখে।","Can’t feed own puppy, keeps Shankaracharya’s dog.","Nijer shabar khai nei, shankaracharya kukur rakhe",Taking on more than you can handle.,"This Bengali idiom, ""নিজের খেতে নেই চাল, শাকারাচার্য্যর কুকুর পোষে"" (Nijer Khete Nei Chal, Shankaracharyar Kukur Poshe), means that ""He has no food for himself, but keeps a dog like Shankaracharya."" This idiom means it is used to describe a situation where an individual is struggling financially or lacks basic necessities for themselves, yet foolishly spends on luxuries, indulges in unnecessary expenses, or maintains extravagant habits that they clearly cannot afford. It highlights a disconnect between one's means and their lifestyle choices, pointing to misplaced priorities or a misguided attempt to maintain appearances despite personal hardship, much like a pauper pretending to live like a wealthy sage who can afford many dogs.

For a powerful image, envision a person with tattered clothes and an empty rice bowl, yet proudly parading a large, well-fed dog on a jeweled leash, symbolizing misplaced priorities and living beyond one's means."
Images/3323.png,নিজের স্বার্থে পাগলেও তৎপর।,Even a madman is active for his own interest.,Nijer sharthe pagle-o totpor,Everyone acts in self-interest.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পাগলেও নিজের ভালো বোঝে"" (Pagoleo Nijer Bhalo Bojhe), means that ""Even a madman is active for his own self-interest."" This idiom means it powerfully suggests that everyone, regardless of their mental state, perceived irrationality, or intellectual capacity, possesses an innate drive to protect and pursue their own interests. It implies that even someone considered ""mad"" will become alert, focused, and strategic when their personal benefit or survival is at stake, highlighting the universal and fundamental nature of self-preservation and self-interest as a motivator.

For a powerful image, envision a person with disheveled clothes and a distant gaze, appearing disoriented, who suddenly becomes sharply focused and agile when a valuable coin rolls near their foot, quickly securing it with surprising precision, symbolizing instinctual self-interest overcoming apparent irrationality."
Images/3324.png,নিজের জিনিস সবাই ভালো বলে।,Everyone says their own thing is best.,Nijer jinish shobai bhalo bole,People overvalue their own possessions.,"This Bengali idiom, ""সবাই নিজের জিনিস ভালো বলে"" (Sobai Nijer Jinish Bhalo Bole), means that ""Everyone praises their own things as good."" This idiom means it highlights the common human tendency to naturally overvalue, glorify, or be biased towards one's own possessions, creations, ideas, or children, often overlooking their flaws or shortcomings. It suggests that personal attachment and pride lead to a subjective assessment, where one's own belongings are invariably seen in the most favorable light, regardless of their objective quality. It's used to caution against blindly trusting someone's self-assessment.

For a powerful image, envision various individuals proudly showcasing their creations—a cracked pot, a poorly painted canvas, a lopsided cake—each genuinely believing theirs is a masterpiece, while objective observers subtly roll their eyes, symbolizing inherent bias towards one's own creations."
Images/3325.png,নুন আনলে পান্তা ফুরায়।,"If you bring salt, the rice water runs out.",Noon anle panta furay,"When one thing is solved, another problem arises.","This Bengali idiom, ""লবণ আনতে পান্তা ফুরায়"" (Lobon Ante Panta Furay), means that ""When salt is brought, the stale rice runs out."" This idiom means it vividly describes a situation of extreme poverty and perpetual scarcity, where daily survival is a continuous struggle against destitution. It implies that by the time one manages to acquire even the most basic and inexpensive necessity (like salt), another equally fundamental resource (like leftover, stale rice) has already been consumed or exhausted, symbolizing a never-ending cycle of hand-to-mouth existence where needs are barely, if ever, met simultaneously.

For a powerful image, envision a thin hand reaching out to place a pinch of salt into a bowl, only to find the bowl already empty of rice, with a stark, shadowy background emphasizing the relentless cycle of destitution and unfulfilled basic needs."
Images/3326.png,তুই কাজ তো খই ভাজ।,"You do the work, I eat the puffed rice.",Tui kaj to khoi bhaj,Someone else enjoys the fruits of your labor.,"This Bengali idiom, ""খোই ভাজার মতো নিজের কাজ করে যাও"" (Khoi Bhajar Moto Nijer Kaj Kore Jao), means that ""You just do your work, like frying puffed rice."" This idiom means it emphasizes the importance of focusing solely and diligently on one's own task, without unnecessary fuss, distraction, or interference from external matters. It likens effective work to the simple, continuous process of frying 'khoi' (puffed rice), which requires consistent attention to prevent burning. It's often used as an admonition to someone to concentrate on their responsibilities and avoid meddling or being sidetracked by others' affairs, underscoring diligence and non-interference.

For a powerful image, envision a person diligently stirring puffed rice over a flame, their gaze fixed on the pan, while blurred, distracting figures and chaotic scenes swirl around them in the background, symbolizing focused dedication to one's own task amidst distractions"
Images/3327.png,"তোর কপট, তোর নয়।","Your cunning, not yours.","Tor kopot, tor noy",Deceit doesn’t benefit the deceiver.,"This Bengali idiom, ""তোমার ছল তোমার নয়"" (Tomar Chhol Tomar Noy), means that ""Your deceit is not yours"" or ""Your cunning is not yours."" This idiom means it implies that a person's deception, cunning, or ill-gotten gains are not truly beneficial or inherent to them, and will ultimately be exposed, fail, or turn against them. It suggests that dishonesty is a precarious foundation, and whatever temporary advantage it brings is fleeting and will eventually lead to negative consequences, as such ""false"" attributes or gains do not genuinely belong to the deceiver and cannot sustain them. It warns against the futility of relying on trickery.

For a powerful image, envision a hand delicately arranging an illusion of stacked gold coins that shimmer momentarily before dissolving into dust, revealing the empty, trembling hand beneath, symbolizing how ill-gotten gains and deception ultimately lead to nothing substantial."
Images/3328.png,"যাঁহাঙ্গার নাই, ব্যবসায়ীর ভয় নাই।","No warehouse, no fear for the merchant.","Jahangar nai, byabshayir bhoy nai","No assets, no worries.","This Bengali idiom, ""যেখানে জাহাঙ্গীর নেই, সেখানে বণিকের ভয় নেই"" (Jekhane Jahangir Nei, Sekhane Boniker Bhoy Nei), means that ""Where there is no Jahangir, a businessman has no fear."" This idiom means that when a powerful, unpredictable, or oppressive authority figure (or a dominant, risky element) is absent, those engaged in business or other ventures can operate freely, without fear of exploitation, arbitrary rules, or confiscation. It highlights that the absence of tyrannical power fosters an environment of security and removes the obstacles to peaceful and prosperous enterprise, emphasizing freedom from an overbearing presence.

For a powerful image, envision a bustling marketplace where merchants freely exchange goods and count profits under a clear sky, while a dark, imposing storm cloud, previously casting a long shadow of a king's silhouette, is now dissipating entirely from the horizon, symbolizing an environment free from tyrannical threat."
Images/3329.png,"যাঁড়া একবারই তাপে, ছোঁয়া যায় না।","Once burned, can’t be touched again.","Jara ekbar-i tape, chhoa jay na","Once hurt, people become cautious.","This Bengali idiom, ""একবার গরম হলে ছোঁয়া যায় না"" (Ekbar Gorom Hole Chhoyajay Na), means that ""That which heats up only once, cannot be touched."" This idiom means it metaphorically refers to something (or someone) that is extremely intense, dangerous, or unapproachable after a single, powerful display of its true nature. It implies that one should exercise extreme caution, or complete avoidance, because its single, impactful demonstration of power or harmfulness makes it too perilous to engage with further. It's often used for things that are ferociously hot, or people who have shown extreme anger or volatility once, making them forever ""untouchable"" in terms of further interaction.

For a powerful image, envision a once-calm pool of water now violently churning with a single, massive eruption of steam and fire, radiating an untouchable heat, with small, cautious figures observing from a safe distance, symbolizing something or someone whose singular display of intensity makes them permanently unapproachable."
Images/3330.png,পক্ষপাতদুষ্ট চোখে কারও ভালো দেখা যায় না।,"With biased eyes, no one looks good.",Pokkhopatdushto chokhe karor bhalo dekha jay na,Bias clouds judgment.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পক্ষপাতদুষ্ট চোখে অন্যের ভালো দেখা যায় না"" (Pokkhopaatdushto Chokhe Onner Bhalo Dekha Jay Na), means that ""With prejudiced eyes, one cannot see anyone's good."" This idiom means it highlights the corrosive effect of bias, prejudice, or preconceived notions on one's perception. It asserts that when an individual views others through the lens of partiality or pre-judgment, they become fundamentally incapable of recognizing, appreciating, or acknowledging the positive qualities, good intentions, or true merits of those they are biased against. The idiom emphasizes that prejudice distorts reality, blinding one to the inherent goodness or positive attributes that may exist, making objective assessment impossible.

For a powerful image, envision a person looking through spectacles with one lens clear and the other severely distorted and clouded, through which they see others as grotesque or flawed, while a wise figure beside them points to the clear lens, symbolizing how prejudice blinds one to others' true goodness."
Images/3331.png,পচা আদার ঝাঁঝ বেশি।,Rotten ginger is more pungent.,Pocha adar jhanj beshi,The worst people make the most noise.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পচা আদার ঝাল বেশি"" (Pocha Adar Jhaal Beshi), means that ""Rotten ginger has more pungency."" This idiom means individuals who are corrupt, morally compromised, or of low character often display excessive aggression, malice, or a sharp, unpleasant demeanor. Just as decaying ginger develops a more intense and acrid pungency, people with flawed ethics tend to exhibit disproportionate anger, bitterness, or a particularly nasty disposition, making them difficult and unpleasant to deal with. It highlights how moral decay can manifest as increased harshness or negativity.

For a powerful image, envision a piece of withered, green-tinged ginger emitting a disproportionately harsh, stinging vapor that causes figures around it to recoil in discomfort, symbolizing how moral decay amplifies negative traits in individuals."
Images/3332.png,"পড়ার কথা ইবার মার্জ, ওর কথা ওর গায়ে বারজ।","Study what’s needed, let others be.","Porar kotha ibar marj, or kotha or gaye barj",Mind your own business.,"This Bengali idiom, ""লেখকের কথা লিখলে চলে যায়, নিজের কথা গায়ে লেগে থাকে"" (Lekhoker Katha Likhle Chole Jay, Nijer Katha Gae Lege Thake), means that ""The words of the scholar should be refined, but his own words stick to him."" This idiom means while a person of knowledge or a learned individual should speak with precision, clarity, and refinement, their true character and personal biases often inevitably manifest in their spontaneous or uninhibited speech. It implies that despite efforts to present a polished persona, one's genuine nature, ingrained beliefs, or inherent flaws will eventually reveal themselves through their unguarded words, becoming an indelible part of their identity.

For a powerful image, envision a scholar meticulously writing elegant words that float away like wisps of smoke, while other, more raw and unpolished words cling visibly to their clothes, revealing their true, unedited self."
Images/3333.png,পথ চলার আগে চিন্তা কর।,Think before you walk the path.,Poth cholar age chinta kor,Think before you act.,"This Bengali idiom, ""দেখে পা বাড়াও"" (Dekhe Pa Barao), means that ""Think before you walk the path."" This idiom means it serves as a powerful admonition to exercise caution, foresight, and careful deliberation before embarking on any significant endeavor, making a major decision, or committing to a course of action. It emphasizes the critical importance of planning, weighing consequences, and understanding potential challenges well in advance, rather than rushing blindly into situations. It suggests that a moment of thoughtful consideration can prevent much future regret or hardship, highlighting the wisdom of preparation over impulsive action.

For a powerful image, envision a person standing at the edge of a winding, mist-shrouded path, pausing with a thoughtful expression to carefully examine a detailed map before taking their first step, symbolizing deliberate foresight before action."
Images/3334.png,পদ্মমূলে কইলাপ।,"At the lotus root, the frog.",Podmumoole koilap,Being at the source but not benefiting.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পদ্মপাতার আলাপ"" (Podmopatar Alap), means that ""A conversation at the base of a lotus."" This idiom means it suggests a discussion or effort that is ultimately fruitless, irrelevant, or fails to address the actual core issue, focusing instead on superficial or disconnected matters. It implies talking around the point rather than to it, making the effort ineffective, like discussing trivialities beneath something as significant and beautiful as a lotus, without ever touching its essence.

For a powerful image, envision a group of figures earnestly conversing at the base of a majestic lotus plant, their words depicted as tiny, meaningless bubbles that float aimlessly around the stem, completely ignoring the blossoming flower above, symbolizing a discussion that misses the core point."
Images/3335.png,পয়সা যোগাড়ে টাকা হয়।,Coins make up money.,Poisha jogare taka hoy,Small savings add up.,"This Bengali idiom, ""কণা কণা করে মণি হয়"" (Kona Kona Kore Moni Hoy), means that ""By accumulating small coins, large money is made."" This idiom means it pragmatically emphasizes the power of incremental savings, consistent effort, and patient accumulation of small gains to achieve significant financial wealth or large-scale success. It encourages prudence, discipline, and a long-term perspective, suggesting that substantial resources or achievements are not often gained instantly but rather through the diligent aggregation of smaller, consistent contributions. It champions the idea that every small contribution adds up.

For a powerful image, envision a steady trickle of tiny, gleaming coins slowly filling a vast, transparent vault, which gradually transforms into a mountain of treasure, symbolizing how small, consistent contributions lead to substantial wealth or success over time."
Images/3336.png,পরিশ্রম সৌভাগ্যের প্রসূতি।,Hard work is the mother of fortune.,Porishrom shoubhagyer proshuti,Hard work brings success.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পরিশ্রম সৌভাগ্যের প্রসূতি"" (Porishrom Soubhagger Prosuti), means that ""Hard work is the mother of good fortune."" This idiom means it powerfully asserts a fundamental truth: diligence, strenuous effort, and unwavering perseverance are the primary genesis of success, prosperity, and fortunate outcomes. It dismisses the notion of unearned luck, emphasizing that true ""good fortune"" is not merely a chance occurrence but is actively cultivated and brought forth through dedicated labor and persistent commitment. The idiom champions the idea that one creates their own luck through sheer effort.

For a powerful image, envision a figure diligently toiling in a barren field, cultivating the dry earth, and as their sweat falls, golden sprouts of prosperity emerge from the ground, symbolizing how sustained effort directly gives birth to good fortune."
Images/3337.png,পরিচ্ছন্নতা ঈশ্বরত্বের অঙ্গ।,Cleanliness is a part of godliness.,Porichhonnata ishwortwer ongo,Cleanliness is next to godliness.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পরিষ্কার পরিচ্ছন্নতা ঈশ্বরের প্রতি ভক্তির চিহ্ন"" (Porishkar Porichchonnota Ishwerer Proti Bhoktir Chinno), means that ""Cleanliness is next to godliness."" This idiom means it emphasizes the profound importance of maintaining physical, mental, and spiritual purity and tidiness. It suggests that a state of cleanliness, order, and meticulousness is not merely a practical habit but a virtue that aligns one with higher ideals, moral uprightness, and spiritual grace. It implies that inner peace and closeness to the divine are fostered through a disciplined commitment to personal and environmental cleanliness, equating purity with virtue.

For a powerful image, envision a sparkling, pristine spring of water flowing into a tranquil pool, reflecting a pure, ascending light, while a figure meticulously cleanses their hands and face, with rays of light subtly connecting them to the divine, symbolizing inner and outer purity."
Images/3338.png,পরের দুঃখ কেউ বোঝে না।,No one understands another’s sorrow.,Porer dukh keu bojhe na,People are indifferent to others’ pain.,"This Bengali idiom, ""যার ব্যথা সেই বোঝে, অন্যে বোঝে না"" (Jar Byatha Shei Bojhe, Onnye Bojhe Na), means that ""No one understands another's sorrow."" This idiom means it expresses the profound and often isolating truth that the depth and nuances of an individual's suffering are inherently subjective and can rarely be fully comprehended or genuinely empathized with by others. It suggests that while people may offer sympathy, the unique burden, pain, and inner turmoil experienced by someone facing hardship remain intimately personal and largely inexpressible, highlighting the inherent solitude of profound grief or struggle.

For a powerful image, envision a person shrouded in a personal mist of sorrow, while others around them offer sympathetic but ineffective gestures, their own expressions of pain remaining unseen and unshared beyond their isolating cloud."
Images/3339.png,পরের ধন প্রায়শ্চিত্ত হয়।,Another’s wealth brings repentance.,Porer dhon prayashchitto hoy,Ill-gotten gains bring regret.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পরের ধনে পোদ্দারি"" (Porar Dhone Poddari), means that ""Another's wealth becomes atonement."" This idiom means it warns that wealth or property acquired through dishonest means, ill-gotten gains, or by taking what rightfully belongs to someone else, will ultimately lead to negative consequences, suffering, or some form of retribution or ""atonement"" for the wrongdoer. It emphasizes that ill-gotten gains bring no true peace or lasting benefit, but rather a hidden cost that demands repayment, often in the form of misfortune or moral decay, highlighting a karmic justice where ill-gotten gains eventually become a source of suffering.

For a powerful image, envision a person triumphantly holding bags of ill-gotten gold, which then slowly transform into heavy, glowing chains wrapping around their own body, symbolizing how dishonestly acquired wealth becomes a burden of future suffering or retribution."
Images/3340.png,পাকা তোক ফাঁকা কথায় ধরা যায় না।,A ripe jackfruit can’t be caught with empty words.,Paka tok faka kothay dhora jay na,Wise people aren’t fooled by empty talk.,"This Bengali idiom, ""কাঁচা লোক ফাঁকা কথায় ভোলে না"" (Kancha Lok Fanka Kathay Bhole Na), means that ""A ripe person cannot be caught with empty words."" This idiom means that an experienced, mature, and shrewd individual (a ""ripe person"") cannot be easily deceived, manipulated, or impressed by superficial flattery, empty promises, or insincere talk (""empty words""). It suggests that such a person sees through pretense and values substance over superficiality, highlighting their wisdom and discernment in recognizing genuine intent versus hollow rhetoric. They are too seasoned to fall for tricks or baseless assurances.

For a powerful image, envision a wise, serene figure standing amidst a storm of swirling, empty speech bubbles that harmlessly dissipate around them, while their eyes remain fixed on a single, small, solid truth held in their hand, symbolizing how seasoned individuals are immune to hollow rhetoric."
Images/3341.png,"পাগলে না বলে, ছাগলে না খায়।",Neither madmen say nor goats eat.,"Pagle na bole, chagle na khay",Some things are universally rejected.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পাগলে কথা কয় না, ছাগলে ঘাস খায় না"" (Pagole Katha Koy Na, Chagole Ghash Khay Na), means that ""A madman doesn't speak, a goat doesn't eat."" This idiom means it highlights situations where something is inherently impossible or goes against nature, often used to express utter disbelief or the impossibility of an event. Just as a madman cannot be reasoned with to speak coherently, and a goat, known for eating almost anything, would never refuse food, the idiom emphasizes that some things are simply beyond the realm of possibility or logical expectation. It's used to underscore the absurdity or extreme unlikelihood of a given scenario.

For a powerful image, envision a madman standing silent amidst attempts to coax words from him, while beside him, a hungry goat turns its nose up at a lush pile of grass, both defying their natural tendencies in a visually absurd and impossible scenario."
Images/3342.png,"পান না পাই, খান না।","If you don’t get betel, don’t eat.","Pan na pai, khan na","If you can’t get what you want, don’t settle.","This Bengali idiom, ""পান না পেলে খাবেন না"" (Pan Na Pele Khben Na), means that ""If you don't find betel leaf, don't eat."" This idiom means it advises against acting without the necessary resources or prerequisites, implying that one should not attempt a task or indulge in something if they lack the essential components or permission. It promotes practicality and prudence, suggesting that engaging in an activity without the proper means will lead to an undesirable outcome or is simply inappropriate. The idiom underscores the importance of readiness and having all the right elements in place before proceeding.

For a powerful image, envision a person about to prepare a meal, but their hand hovers uncertainly over an empty spice box, while a finished, unseasoned dish sits unappetizingly nearby, symbolizing the folly of proceeding without essential ingredients."
Images/3343.png,পাপ ছাড়ে না বাপকে।,Sin doesn’t spare even the father.,Pap chhare na bapke,No one escapes the consequences of their actions.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পাপে বাপকেও ছাড়ে না"" (Pape Bapkeo Chhare Na), means that ""Sin does not spare even the father."" This idiom means it conveys the inescapable and far-reaching consequences of one's misdeeds, emphasizing that wrongdoing will inevitably catch up to the perpetrator, regardless of their status, power, or familial ties. It asserts that karma or divine justice is relentless and impartial, ensuring that no one, not even a revered figure like a father, can escape the repercussions of their sins. The idiom serves as a powerful moral warning against engaging in unethical or harmful actions.

For a powerful image, envision a dark shadow of ill deeds creeping relentlessly behind a figure, eventually encompassing even an idealized, strong paternal figure standing by their side, symbolizing how the consequences of sin are inescapable, even for those revered."
Images/3344.png,পুরনো অভ্যাস তাড়াতাড়ি যায় না।,Old habits don’t go away quickly.,Purono obhyash taratari jay na,Old habits die hard.,"This Bengali idiom, ""পুরানো অভ্যাস সহজে যায় না"" (Purono Obbhas Shohoje Jay Na), means that ""Old habits don't go away quickly."" This idiom means it highlights the inherent difficulty in breaking deeply ingrained routines, behaviors, or tendencies, even when one consciously tries to change. It emphasizes the persistent nature of established patterns, whether good or bad, and acknowledges that genuine transformation requires significant time, effort, and perseverance, as old habits have a remarkable tendency to resurface or linger despite one's best intentions. It's often used with a sense of understanding or resignation when old patterns resurface.

For a powerful image, envision a person meticulously building a new, straight path, only for a faint, old, winding trail to continually resurface behind them, despite their efforts to cover it, symbolizing the persistent nature of ingrained habits."
Images/3345.png,প্রেম অন্ধ।,Love is blind.,Prem andho,Love overlooks faults.,"This Bengali idiom, ""প্রেম অন্ধ"" (Prem Ondho), means that ""Love is blind."" This idiom means it captures the essence of how deep affection or infatuation can often obscure a person's judgment, making them oblivious to the flaws, shortcomings, or even the true nature of the beloved or the reality of a situation related to their love. It implies that love can lead one to overlook faults, ignore warnings, or make irrational decisions, as the powerful emotion overrides logical perception and critical assessment.

For a powerful image, envision a person with a heartfelt smile and stars in their eyes, wearing a blindfold while holding hands with another figure who has exaggerated flaws visible to everyone but them, symbolizing how love can obscure judgment and reality."
Images/3346.png,প্রেম বিজয়ী।,Love is victorious.,Prem bijoyi,Love conquers all.,"This Bengali idiom, ""প্রেমই জয়ী"" (Prem-i Joyi), means that ""Love is victorious"" or ""Love conquers all."" This idiom means it expresses the belief that the powerful force of love, in its various forms (romantic, familial, platonic, or even universal compassion), possesses the ultimate ability to overcome all obstacles, resolve conflicts, transcend differences, and ultimately triumph over adversity, hatred, or division. It suggests that love is an unstoppable and all-conquering force that can unite, heal, and prevail against any challenge.

For a powerful image, envision a vibrant, glowing heart at the center of a chaotic battlefield, emitting ripples of warmth that gradually dissipate weapons, transform angry faces into smiles, and bridge divides, symbolizing love's power to conquer all forms of adversity."
Images/3347.png,প্রেমে ও যুদ্ধে সব কিছুই বৈধ।,All is fair in love and war.,Preme o juddhe shob kichui boidho,Anything goes in love and war.,"This Bengali idiom, ""প্রেম আর যুদ্ধে সবই ন্যায্য"" (Prem Ar Juddhe Shobai Nayajjo), means that ""Everything is fair in love and war."" This idiom means it suggests that in the intense and high-stakes arenas of romantic pursuit and actual warfare, conventional rules, ethics, or moral principles are often suspended, and any means, no matter how unconventional or morally ambiguous, are considered permissible to achieve one's ultimate objective. It implies a no-holds-barred approach where the desire for victory (in love or battle) justifies all actions, often used to rationalize aggressive or manipulative tactics.

For a powerful image, envision a chess game where the pieces are also battling on a separate, chaotic battlefield, and a shadowy hand from the ""love"" side is subtly moving pieces on the ""war"" side, implying that all tactics are justified for victory in both domains."
Images/3348.png,বৃক্ষ তোমার নাম কি? ফলে পরিচয়।,What’s your tree’s name? Its fruit tells.,Brikkho tomar nam ki? phole porichoy,A person is known by their deeds.,"This Bengali idiom, ""নাম কি, গাছ? ফলে পরিচয়"" (Nam Ki, Gachh? Fole Porichoy), means that ""What is your name, tree? By your fruit, you are known."" This idiom means it asserts that a person's true nature, character, and capabilities are ultimately revealed and defined not by their words, claims, or outward appearance, but by their actions, achievements, or the tangible results they produce. It emphasizes that genuine identity and worth are demonstrated through concrete outcomes, much like a tree is identified by the fruit it bears, rather than by its leaves or branches alone. It's a call to judge by deeds, not by mere assertions.

For a powerful image, envision a beautifully leafed tree with a grand sign proclaiming its name, while below it, its true nature is revealed only by the distinct fruit it bears, some perhaps unexpectedly sour or sweet, symbolizing that true character is shown by actions, not words."
Images/3349.png,ফাঁড়ক দরলে ছাগে রব্বারনা।,"If you tie a rope, the goat won’t bleat.",Fark dorle chage robbarna,Restriction silences protest.,"This Bengali idiom, ""ফাঁদে পড়লে ছাগলও গুঁতোয় না"" (Fande Porle Chagoleo Gutoy Na), means that ""If a goat is caught in a trap, it won't butt."" This idiom means it implies that when someone is in a helpless or critical situation, caught in a difficult predicament, or under extreme duress, they lose their usual assertiveness, aggression, or ability to resist. It suggests that facing overwhelming constraints makes even the most defiant or stubborn individuals compliant and powerless, highlighting how vulnerability strips one of their usual fight.

For a powerful image, envision a usually defiant goat caught firmly in a net, its horns lowered and eyes showing resignation, completely devoid of its usual head-butting aggression, symbolizing how severe constraint removes one's ability to resist."
Images/3350.png,ফুরেরও কাঁটা আছে।,Even cotton has thorns.,Furer-o kanta ache,Everything has its problems.,"This Bengali idiom, ""ফুলে কাঁটাও থাকে"" (Fule Kanta Thake), means that ""Even a flower has thorns."" This idiom means it serves as a reminder that even things, people, or situations that appear beautiful, appealing, or harmless on the surface can possess hidden flaws, difficulties, dangers, or unpleasant aspects. It encourages a realistic and cautious perspective, advising against being entirely swayed by outward charm or superficial beauty, as there might be underlying problems or negative traits that are not immediately apparent. It highlights the often-complex nature of reality, where perfection is rarely found without some accompanying imperfection.

For a powerful image, envision a visually stunning, vibrant rose, enticingly beautiful, but as a hand reaches to touch it, sharp, almost invisible thorns prick the skin, symbolizing that even beauty holds hidden dangers or imperfections.
"
Images/3351.png,তফন দরলে ভাত খায় গল্প মারার দই।,"When the storm comes, eat rice and tell stories.",Tofan dorle bhat khay golpo marar doi,"In crisis, people relax and chat.","This Bengali idiom, ""যে খাটে, সে ভাত খায়, যে গল্প করে, সে দই খায়"" (Je Khate, Se Bhat Khay, Je Golpo Kore, Se Doi Khay), means that ""The one who works hard eats rice, the one who tells tales eats yogurt."" This idiom means it highlights the stark contrast between those who diligently work and earn their sustenance through honest labor, and those who avoid real effort, relying instead on gossip, empty talk, or superficial charm to gain benefits. It champions the value of hard work and dismisses idleness and unproductive chatter, suggesting that true rewards come from genuine effort, not from mere storytelling or manipulation.

For a powerful image, envision a farmer toiling in a field, then sitting down to a steaming bowl of rice, radiating quiet satisfaction, while in a lavish setting nearby, a well-dressed storyteller holds court, enjoying a decadent bowl of yogurt, their sustenance derived from words rather than sweat, visually emphasizing the different sources of reward for diligence versus idleness."
Images/3352.png,"বজ্র আঁটুনি, ফস্কা গেরো।","Tight knot, loose end.","Bojro atuni, foska gero","Strong start, weak finish.","This Bengali idiom, ""বজ্র আঁটুনি, ফস্কা গেরো"" (Bojro Atuni, Foska Gero), means that ""Thunderous knot, loose tie."" This idiom means it vividly describes a situation that appears to be extremely strong, secure, and foolproof on the surface, but in reality, contains a fatal flaw, a hidden weakness, or a critical point of failure that makes it easily undone or ineffective. It's used when something designed to be unbreakable or perfectly secure turns out to be surprisingly fragile or easily circumvented, highlighting a deceptive appearance of strength.

For a powerful image, envision a massive, chained gate with formidable locks, yet a single, almost invisible thread holding the main bolt, which, when tugged lightly, causes the entire grand structure to collapse effortlessly, symbolizing a deceptive appearance of strength with a hidden, fatal flaw."
Images/3353.png,বড় হতে চাইলে ছোট হতে শিখো।,"To be big, learn to be small.",Boro hote chaile chhoto hote shikho,Humility is the path to greatness.,"This Bengali idiom, ""বড় হতে হলে নত হতে হয়"" (Boro Hote Hole Noto Hote Hoy), means that ""If you want to be great, learn to be humble."" This idiom means it imparts a timeless lesson about true leadership, wisdom, and personal growth. It emphasizes that genuine greatness, respect, and influence are not achieved through arrogance, self-importance, or dominating others, but rather through humility, self-effacement, empathy, and a willingness to serve or learn from those perceived as ""smaller"" or less significant. It suggests that true elevation comes from a spirit of modesty and service.

For a powerful image, envision a towering, majestic tree whose highest branches gracefully bow down to touch the smallest saplings at its base, symbolizing that true greatness is exemplified by humility and a willingness to connect with and uplift those less significant."
Images/3354.png,"বেঁচে বেঁচে নিজের বাঁচা, পরের বাঁচা পারছ।","Save yourself first, then others.","Beche beche nije bacha, porer bacha parcho",Self-preservation comes first.,"This Bengali idiom, ""নিজেকে বাঁচালে অন্যকে বাঁচানো হয়, আর অন্যকে বাঁচালে নিজেকে বাঁচানো হয়"" (Nijeke Bachale Onnyoke Bachano Hoy, Ar Onnyoke Bachale Nijeke Bachano Hoy), means that ""You save yourself by saving others, and by saving others, you save yourself."" This idiom means it encapsulates a profound reciprocal truth: true self-preservation and well-being are inextricably linked to helping and supporting others. It suggests that acts of compassion, altruism, and collective upliftment ultimately lead to one's own prosperity, security, and inner peace. It champions the interconnectedness of human lives and the principle that generosity and mutual aid are the most effective forms of long-term survival and flourishing, emphasizing that self-interest is best served through collective good.

For a powerful image, envision two figures caught in a swirling current, each extending a hand to pull the other to safety, forming a continuous loop of mutual support, where the act of saving the other simultaneously secures their own survival, symbolizing the reciprocal nature of collective aid.

Images/3355.png,"বয়স, বুদ্ধি, ভারি চল্লিশ হলে ভারি।","Age, wisdom, weight—heavy at forty.","Boyosh, buddhi, bhari chollish hole bhari",With age comes wisdom and responsibility.,"This Bengali idiom, ""চল্লিশ পেরোলে বুদ্ধি বাড়ে"" (Cholliesh Perole Buddhi Bare), means that ""Age, wisdom, heavy (significant) when one turns forty."" This idiom means the age of forty marks a pivotal period in life where one is expected to have accumulated significant wisdom, maturity, and a deeper understanding of life. It implies that by this age, individuals should possess not just experience (age) but also sound judgment (buddhi), making them substantial or weighty (bhari) in their character and decisions. It suggests a prime time for intellectual and emotional gravitas, often used to remark on someone who has reached this age and embodies these qualities, or perhaps to implicitly point out if they haven't.

For a powerful image, envision a figure standing at a crossroads, their younger self fading behind them while their path ahead glows with a steady, inner light. Around them, symbols of life's experiences—a weathered book, a gnarled tree, a calm pool of water—converge and integrate into their being, visually representing the accumulation of wisdom. The figure's posture is one of calm assurance, their gaze thoughtful and discerning, reflecting the deep understanding and gravitas that comes with reaching this significant age."
Images/3356.png,"বলা সহজ, করা কঠিন।","Saying is easy, doing is hard.","Bola shohoj, kora kothin",Actions speak louder than words.,"This Bengali idiom, ""বলা সহজ, করা কঠিন"" (Bola Shohoj, Kora Kothin), means that ""Saying is easy, doing is difficult."" This idiom means the significant disparity between vocalizing an idea, a promise, or a task, and actually executing it effectively. It highlights the common human tendency to make grand statements or offer simplistic solutions without fully comprehending or acknowledging the practical challenges, effort, and complexities involved in turning words into action. It serves as a reminder of the gap between theoretical knowledge or intention and practical application, emphasizing that true accomplishment lies in execution, not just discourse.

For a powerful image, envision a speaker confidently delivering a complex blueprint for a towering structure, their words forming effortless, floating bubbles; in stark contrast, below them, a group of builders struggles physically with heavy materials and intricate tools, their faces strained with effort, depicting the immense practical challenges of construction, visually emphasizing the ease of verbalizing a grand idea versus the arduous reality of its actual creation, with the speaker's effortless words hovering above the tangible, difficult work."
Images/3357.png,ব্যবহারই মানুষকে চেনে।,Behavior shows a person’s character.,Byabohar-i manushke chene,People are known by their behavior.,"This Bengali idiom, ""আচরণে পরিচয়"" (Achorone Porichoy), means that ""Behavior defines a person."" This idiom describes that a person's true character, nature, and moral standing are best revealed not by their words, claims, or outward appearance, but by their actions, conduct, and how they treat others. It emphasizes that consistent behavior serves as the ultimate determinant of one's identity and reputation, suggesting that actions speak louder than words in truly understanding who someone is. It's a foundational principle for judging individuals based on their demonstrated conduct.

For a powerful image, envision two figures side-by-side. One stands elegantly dressed, speaking eloquently with grand gestures, yet subtle, negative shadows cling to their hands, hinting at unseen, unkind actions. The other figure, perhaps plainly dressed and quiet, is surrounded by a gentle, radiating light, which illuminates small acts of kindness and integrity they are performing—helping an elderly person, tending to a plant, or sharing a humble meal. The focus of the image is not on their words or appearance, but on the contrasting visual representation of their true character through their actions, with the light around the second figure growing brighter as their subtle good deeds accumulate."
Images/3358.png,বারেব নীরচ অন্ধকার।,Darkness after rain.,Bareb nirach andhokar,Hard times follow good times.,"This Bengali idiom, ""ঘনিয়ে ঘনিয়ে আঁধার"" (Ghonie Ghonie Andhar), means that ""Repeatedly, dense darkness."" This idiom describes a situation where despite repeated attempts or a consistent struggle, success or improvement remains elusive, and one continues to face failure, despair, or an inability to overcome challenges. It evokes a persistent state of gloom, stagnation, or hopelessness, where every effort only leads back to the same profound difficulties, emphasizing an unending cycle of misfortune or an inability to find a way out.

For a powerful image, envision a lone figure perpetually lost within an oppressive, ever-expanding darkness. Each step they take, each desperate reach for a glimmer of light, only plunges them deeper into the gloom.

Around them, faint, fleeting glimmers of hope appear—a distant lantern, a crack of dawn—but are instantly swallowed by the encroaching shadows, symbolizing the continuous cycle of misfortune and the inability to find a way out."
Images/3359.png,"বাপকা তবিা, রিপাহীকা তঘাড়া।","Father’s nature, soldier’s horse.","Bapka tabia, ripahika taghara","Like father, like son.","This Bengali idiom বাপকা তবিা, রিপাহীকা তঘাড়া।, a phrase of mixed origin, means, ""A father's drum, a soldier's horse."" This idiom implies that certain things are inherently tied to and best utilized by their rightful or traditional owner, becoming meaningless or ineffective in the hands of others. It signifies that one should stick to their own forte, or that specific tools and roles are best suited for specific people or professions, highlighting a sense of inherent belonging and effectiveness.

To illustrate this, imagine a split image or a diptych. On one side, a wise, elderly village elder or patriarch sits calmly. A beautiful, ornate drum rests perfectly in their lap or beside them, symbolizing their inherent authority and ability to command respect. The drum appears in harmony with the elder, radiating tradition. On the other side, a strong, disciplined soldier stands tall, fully armored. A majestic, powerful horse, saddled and alert, stands beside them, ready for battle, conveying speed and purpose. In a subtle way, out-of-place elements could be shown: perhaps the soldier awkwardly trying to play the drum, producing only discord, or the elder uncomfortably attempting to mount the warhorse, looking out of place. The lighting for each side emphasizes the natural fit and power when the object is with its ""rightful"" owner, underscoring the idiom's core message of inherent purpose and suitability."
Images/3360.png,বাপ-মার চরিত্রই সন্তানের শিক্ষা।,Parents’ character is the child’s lesson.,Bap-mar choritro-i shontaner shikkha,Children learn from parents’ example.,"This Bengali idiomবাপ-মার চরিত্রই সন্তানের শিক্ষা।  means, ""Parents' character is the child's education."" This idiom underscores the immense and undeniable influence of parents' character, actions, and moral conduct on their children's development and upbringing. It signifies that children learn far more through observing their parents' daily behavior, values, and ethical choices than they do from formal lessons or verbal instructions. The idiom champions the idea that parents serve as living textbooks, shaping their offspring's worldview, moral compass, and future actions primarily through the example they set.

To illustrate this, imagine a child depicted with a receptive and observant expression, holding a blank scroll or a piece of clay, ready to absorb. Behind them, their parents are shown engaged in everyday actions – perhaps one is patiently tending a garden, another is sharing food with a neighbor, or quietly reading. Instead of verbal communication, the parents' ""character"" is visibly woven into the scene around them, or subtly radiates from their forms: kindness as warm, golden threads; integrity as strong, straight lines; generosity as a gentle, overflowing light. These visible traits flow directly onto the child's scroll or into the clay, visually demonstrating how the child is unconsciously absorbing and replicating these patterns onto their own being. The lighting emphasizes this flow of influence, making it clear that parental example is the most fundamental form of education, subtly shaping the child's core being.

"
Images/3361.png,বৃষ্টি হলে বহু দুঃখ।,"When it rains, there’s much sorrow.",Brishti hole bahu dukh,Troubles come together.,"This Bengali idiom বৃষ্টি হলে বহু দুঃখ। means, ""If it rains, there is much sorrow."" This idiom highlights how a seemingly neutral event like rain can bring vastly different outcomes for people. To illustrate, picture a split image under a heavy downpour: on one side, a vibrant, well-watered field and smiling people with umbrellas reflect comfort, while on the other, a family in a flimsy shelter struggles against the cascading water, their belongings soaking and faces etched with despair. This stark contrast, unified by the same rain but diverging dramatically in impact, powerfully conveys how a single phenomenon can cause profound suffering for the vulnerable."
Images/3362.png,বীর ভাগ্যবান বন্ধু।,The brave have lucky friends.,Bir bhagyoban bondhu,Fortune favors the brave.,"This Bengali idiom, ""ভাগ্যবানের সাহসী বন্ধু"" (Bhaggobaner Shahoshi Bondhu), means that ""A brave man's lucky friend."" This inspiring Bengali idiom encapsulates the profound idea that courage often acts as a magnet for good fortune and favorable circumstances. It suggests that boldness, daring, and a willingness to face challenges head-on frequently open doors to opportunities or miraculously transform difficult situations into advantageous ones. The proverb implies that luck isn't just random; it inherently favors the audacious and the intrepid, serving as a constant companion to those who possess true bravery and conviction. It champions the idea that taking bold steps, even when fear is present, can powerfully carve out one's own destiny and lead to unexpected positive outcomes.                                                        Imagine a heroic figure poised confidently before a formidable obstacle, like a stormy chasm. While others falter, this courageous individual takes a bold leap into the unknown. As they act, a shimmering golden path or benevolent winds miraculously appear, guiding them safely across. A subtle, ethereal glow, symbolizing luck, moves alongside them, ensuring success. The scene is bathed in optimistic light, with a clear sky ahead, signifying the prosperous outcome that consistently rewards the truly brave."
Images/3363.png,"বৃথা চেষ্টা, ফল নেই।","Useless effort, no result.","Britha chesta, fol nei",Hard work without purpose is wasted.,"This Bengali idiom means that ""Vain effort, no result."" This idiom captures the essence of futility and wasted endeavor. It describes a situation where all the effort poured into a task proves unproductive, leading to no positive outcome. It signifies a pointless struggle, where despite immense exertion, the endeavor yields nothing of value, resulting only in despair and exhaustion.

To illustrate this, imagine a solitary, weary figure toiling relentlessly in a desolate landscape. They're desperately pushing a massive boulder up an impossibly steep hill of loose sand, only for it to continually slide back down, creating a Sisyphean cycle of effort. Other elements reinforce this futility: a watering can pouring drops onto parched ground where nothing grows; a broken clock symbolizing wasted time; or a tangled rope defying all attempts to untangle it. The overcast sky casts a dull, weary light, emphasizing the lack of progress. Every strained muscle on the figure's face speaks of immense, wasted effort, while the barren surroundings underscore the core message of a futile endeavor leading to nothing but exhaustion."
Images/3364.png,"বয়স বাড়ে, বুদ্ধি বাড়ে না।","Age increases, wisdom does not.","Boyosh bare, buddhi bare na",Growing old does not mean growing wise.,"This Bengali idiom বয়স বাড়ে, বুদ্ধি বাড়ে না। means that ""Age increases, but wisdom does not."" This idiom is often used to lament or comment on individuals who, despite accumulating years, fail to mature mentally, learn from life's experiences, or develop greater understanding and discretion. It highlights a noticeable lack of intellectual or emotional growth, suggesting that merely passing time does not automatically bestow sagacity or a deeper comprehension of the world. The idiom points to a stagnation of the mind, contrasting physical aging with an arrested development of true wisdom and insight.

For an evocative image, envision an elderly person, perhaps with a long, flowing white beard or wisps of silver hair, seated in a cluttered room filled with symbols of potential learning and profound thought: towering bookshelves overflowing with unread philosophical tomes, a complex, unsolved chess set gathering dust, or a globe unspun. Their eyes, however, hold a blank stare, a bewildered expression, or even a stubborn, almost childish innocence, rather than the expected depth and sagacity of accumulated knowledge. They might be shown clumsily fumbling with a very simple task, like fitting brightly colored, oversized child's blocks together incorrectly, while sophisticated instruments or challenging puzzles remain untouched nearby. In the background, a subtle visual timeline of their life could unfold—a series of fading photographs transitioning from vibrant youth to advanced old age—yet their current vacant expression remains unchanged, emphasizing a mental stagnation despite the relentless march of time. The lighting is soft but slightly melancholic, casting gentle shadows that highlight the poignant contrast between their advanced physical years and their arrested intellectual or emotional maturity, underscoring the irony of age without true wisdom."
Images/3365.png,"বাঘে ছুঁলে গা যায়, মানুষে ছুঁলে নাম যায়।","Tiger takes your body, man takes your name.","Baghe chhule ga jay, manush chhule nam jay","People destroy reputation, not just life.","This Bengali idiom বাঘে ছুঁলে গা যায়, মানুষে ছুঁলে নাম যায়। means that ""If a tiger touches, the body is lost; if a person touches, the name is lost."" This idiom provides a powerful commentary on the hierarchy of loss, asserting that the destruction of one's reputation can be far more devastating than physical harm. It means that while a physical attack, like that from a wild animal, can destroy the body—a tangible and final end—the intangible harm inflicted by slander, defamation, or a malicious ""touch"" from another human being can utterly destroy one's honor, dignity, and good name, which is often considered a greater and more enduring loss than mere physical death. It speaks to the insidious and far-reaching impact of character assassination and social ruin.

To depict this, create a stark, dual-panel image that vividly contrasts these two forms of destruction. On one side, against a backdrop of raw, aggressive colors like deep reds and blacks, a snarling tiger is depicted in mid-pounce, its claws outstretched towards a fragile, almost transparent human silhouette, emphasizing the physical, mortal threat and the immediate, brutal end of the body. The scene is one of visceral violence. On the other side, bathed in colder, insidious hues of muted grays and purples, a shadowy, indistinct human figure is shown with fingers pointed or lips pursed in a whisper. From their mouth or hand, dark, coiling tendrils of smoke or sharp, jagged words physically manifest, swirling around and relentlessly eroding a bright, pristine nameplate or a shimmering scroll where a person's name is boldly inscribed. As the insidious ""touch"" makes contact, the letters on the nameplate begin to crack, crumble, and fade into dust, illustrating the devastating, often irreparable, destruction of one's honor and good name, a loss far more profound and lasting than mere physical demise."
Images/3366.png,বুদ্ধি থাকলে বাঁচা যায়।,"If you have wisdom, you survive.",Buddhi thakle bacha jay,Intelligence ensures survival.,"This Bengali idiom বুদ্ধি থাকলে বাঁচা যায়। means ""If you have intelligence, you can survive."" This idiom is a testament to the power of sharp intellect and ingenuity in navigating life's myriad challenges. It emphasizes that wit, cleverness, and resourcefulness are crucial for overcoming difficulties and escaping perilous situations. The idiom suggests that intellectual agility often triumphs over brute strength, physical prowess, or even sheer luck, acting as a most reliable tool for self-preservation and success. It's a celebration of strategic thinking and adaptable problem-solving, highlighting that a sharp mind is the ultimate survival tool.

For a dynamic visual, imagine a winding, perilous path through a dense, metaphorical jungle or a complex labyrinth, fraught with obvious and hidden dangers like quicksand, collapsing bridges, and aggressive obstacles. At various points, other figures—perhaps larger, stronger, or simply less astute—are depicted struggling, entangled in vines, or having fallen into visible traps, showcasing their inability to adapt. In stark contrast, a lean, alert individual (representing the intelligent one) moves with effortless grace and precision, their eyes keenly observing their surroundings. They are seen deftly sidestepping a cleverly disguised pressure plate, using a discarded tool to disarm a hidden snare, or interpreting subtle clues like shifted stones or faint air currents to choose the correct, safe passage where others blindly rushed into danger. Soft rays of light might uniquely illuminate the intelligent figure's path, symbolizing their foresight and insight, while the areas where others struggle remain shrouded in deeper shadows. The intelligent person’s expression is one of calm resourcefulness, not struggle, embodying the efficient problem-solving that comes with sharp intellect, with a clear, distant exit symbolizing the reward of their strategic navigation."
Images/3367.png,বাপ-মার দোষে সন্তানের সর্বনাশ।,Parents’ faults ruin the child.,Bap-mar doshe shontaner shorbonash,Children suffer for parents’ mistakes.,"This Bengali idiom বাপ-মার দোষে সন্তানের সর্বনাশ। means that  ""The ruin of a child due to the faults of the parents."" This idiom serves as a stark commentary on the profound and often irreparable damage inflicted upon a child's life and future when their guardians are marred by mistakes, wrongdoings, detrimental habits, or inherent character flaws. The idiom powerfully highlights that a child's suffering and ultimate downfall are frequently a direct and tragic consequence of parental irresponsibility, negligence, or deliberate misdeeds. It underscores a generational burden, where the sins or shortcomings of the parents cast a long, destructive shadow over their offspring's destiny.       For a dynamic visual, imagine a winding, perilous path through a dense, metaphorical jungle or a complex labyrinth, fraught with obvious and hidden dangers like quicksand, collapsing bridges, and aggressive obstacles. At various points, other figures—perhaps larger, stronger, or simply less astute—are depicted struggling, entangled in vines, or having fallen into visible traps, showcasing their inability to adapt.

Images/3368.png,"ভাগ্যবানর বৌ মরলে, অভাগার গরু মরে,","The lucky man’s wife dies, the unlucky man’s cow dies.","Bhagyobaner bou morle, abhagar goru more",Fortune and misfortune are unpredictable.,"The Bengali idiom ""ভাগ্যবানর বৌ মরলে, অভাগার গরু মরে"" (Bhaggobanor bou morle, obhagar goru more) means that""When a lucky man's wife dies, an unlucky man's cow dies."" This idiom primarily conveys the disparate and often unfair nature of misfortune, highlighting how those who are already fortunate seem to experience lesser setbacks, while the unfortunate face devastating losses. It emphasizes the stark contrast in how life's blows are distributed, rather than the idea of risk-taking or courage.     For a compelling image, envision a scene where a young, disheveled figure stands hunched in the foreground, their face etched with a profound sense of despair or emptiness, perhaps surrounded by broken objects or unfulfilled promises that signify their ""ruin."" Behind them, casting a long, insidious shadow over the child, stand the vague, almost spectral forms of two parental figures. Their faces are obscured, but their subtle actions or surrounding elements hint at their ""faults"": one might be subtly raising a glass of alcohol, another perhaps distracted by a glowing screen or a pile of scattered bills, or simply turning their back, oblivious. The overall lighting on the child should be dim and cold, contrasting with the faint, almost sickly glow around the parents that subtly emanates the source of the misfortune. The entire composition should create a strong visual narrative where the parents' actions or inaction directly, tragically, leads to the child's desolate state, emphasizing the deep sorrow and generational consequence."
Images/3369.png,ভাগ্যের রেখা নয় ক্ষণ।,Fate’s line is not for a moment.,Bhagyer rekha noy khon,Fate is long-lasting.,"The Bengali idiom ""ভাগ্যের রেখা নয় ক্ষণ।"" means ""It is not the line of fate, but the moment that matters."" Idiomatically, it emphasizes the decisive power of the right moment or timely action over prewritten fate or destiny. It is used in situations where one must act swiftly or seize the opportunity instead of waiting passively for fate to unfold. For an image, imagine a glowing golden thread hovering in the sky above a figure standing at a cliff’s edge. The thread pulses with light only for a few seconds before fading, while multiple ancient stone paths stretch in different directions beneath a twilight sky. A faded palm, symbolizing fate lines, floats ghostlike in the clouds above, cracked and fragmented, while the person below leaps toward the glowing moment. The landscape reflects urgency and stillness in tension—mountains, falling hourglass sand, and streaks of shooting stars—illustrating how a fleeting moment can override the script of destiny."
Images/3370.png,ভাঙা মন জোড়া হয় না।,A broken heart can’t be mended.,Bhanga mon jora hoy na,Some wounds never heal.,"The Bengali idiom ""ভাঙা মন জোড়া হয় না।"" means ""A broken heart cannot be repaired."" Idiomatically, it refers to deep emotional wounds or betrayals that, once inflicted, leave permanent scars that no amount of effort can truly heal. This idiom is used in the aftermath of heartbreak, lost trust, or profound disappointment. For a poignant image, picture a porcelain heart lying on a table, shattered into delicate shards. Someone’s trembling hands are gently trying to piece it together with gold-infused glue (inspired by Kintsugi), yet many cracks remain visible. Around them are faded love letters, withered rose petals, and a stormy window casting streaks of rain across the room. The lighting is dim and moody, with soft candlelight flickering in the gloom, reflecting the fragility of emotional recovery and the irreparable nature of some wounds."
Images/3371.png,ভয়ে পায় না চা খায়।,"Not afraid, drinks tea.",Bhoye pay na cha khay,The fearless are carefree.,"The Bengali idiom ""ভয়ে পায় না চা খায়।"" means ""He’s so fearless, he’s sipping tea without worry."" Idiomatically, it humorously or admiringly describes someone who remains unusually calm, even during serious tension or chaos, showing nonchalance and inner strength. This can be used to describe defiance in the face of danger or casual courage. For an eye-catching image, imagine a smoky war zone or a heated political rally with sirens and running people, but in the middle of the scene sits a calm, elderly man on a wooden stool. He’s dressed in a simple dhoti, quietly sipping tea from an earthen cup, his eyes steady and unflinching. Around him, everything is a blur—news cameras, panic-stricken faces, debris in the wind—yet the man’s composure creates a glowing bubble of peace. Steam from his tea swirls into a lion-shaped cloud, subtly signaling his inner strength."
Images/3372.png,"ভাবিয়া করিও কাজ, করিয়া ভাবিও না।","Think before you act, don’t think after acting.","Bhabiya koriyo kaj, koriya bhabio na","Plan before action, not after.","The Bengali idiom ""ভাবিয়া করিও কাজ, করিয়া ভাবিও না।"" translates as ""Think before you act; don’t act before you think."" Idiomatically, it’s a moral and practical lesson about the importance of planning and consideration, warning against impulsiveness and regret. This idiom fits when advising someone to take a pause before making decisions—whether in relationships, finances, or personal life. For a compelling image, picture a young person standing at a crossroads in a vast, foggy field. One path is paved and well-lit, while another is rocky and uncertain. Above their head float ghostly thought-bubbles showing imagined consequences—some bright, others dark. Behind them lies a broken bridge representing past impulsive choices, while in front, a compass glows faintly in their hand. The air is filled with floating clocks and suspended ink droplets, frozen mid-fall, all conveying the weight of time and contemplation."
Images/3373.png,"ভাবের মাঝে মন, কী বা হার, কী বা ডম।","Mind in emotion, what’s a necklace or drum?","Bhaver majhe mon, ki ba har, ki ba dom",Feelings matter more than possessions.,"The Bengali idiom ""ভাবের মাঝে মন, কী বা হার, কী বা ডম।"" roughly means ""It’s the emotion in the expression that matters, not the instrument."" Idiomatically, it praises heartfelt simplicity over technical brilliance, often used in the context of art, prayer, or communication, where raw emotion outweighs sophistication. For a powerful image, imagine a rural night lit by the golden glow of lanterns, where a lone folk singer sits beneath a tree playing an old ektara. His voice is cracked but soulful, reaching the hearts of an audience of villagers sitting silently with tearful eyes. Nearby lies an untouched, shining sitar leaning against a post—unplayed, pristine. The leaves rustle in harmony, stars twinkle softly above, and the quiet ambience breathes emotion. The message is clear: it is the heart that sings, not the instrument."
Images/3374.png,ভয়ে কাজের পুরষ্কার নেই।,No reward for work done in fear.,Bhoye kajer purushkar nei,Fearful work brings no success.,"The Bengali idiom ""ভয়ে কাজের পুরষ্কার নেই।"" means ""Work done in fear brings no reward."" Idiomatically, it teaches that timidity or nervous hesitation often ruins the result of one’s hard work. It is said to encourage confident, assertive effort in situations where fear might hold someone back—like exams, performances, competitions, or leadership decisions. For the visual, picture a craftsman in a grand hall presenting his masterpiece—a sculpture half-covered in cloth. He hesitates, hand trembling, eyes scanning a stern audience. Behind him, a glowing trophy or garland hovers, but it flickers and dims as his fear grows. In the shadows loom ghostly versions of himself failing to step forward. The hall is majestic but hushed, amplifying the psychological tension and unfulfilled promise."
Images/3375.png,"ভয়ে পায় না, চা খায়।","Not afraid, drinks tea.","Bhoye pay na, cha khay",The fearless are relaxed.,"Same as earlier; The idiom ""ভয়ে পায় না, চা খায়।"" humorously describes someone so unaffected by fear that they can casually sip tea even during high tension. It’s used to highlight extraordinary calm or fearlessness, often in satire. Imagine a train derailment being broadcast on a giant TV screen in a crowded tea stall, with everyone glued to it, anxious and murmuring. Yet, in the corner, a woman with a calm smile dips a biscuit into her tea, unbothered, eyes closed in enjoyment. The bustle blurs around her as her aura glows slightly, reinforcing her inner tranquility. Above her, the steam from the tea morphs into meditative clouds, embodying Zen-like composure in chaos"
Images/3376.png,ভীরুরা মরার আগে দু’বার মরে।,The coward dies twice before death.,Bhirura morar age du bar more,Cowards suffer more than the brave.,"The Bengali idiom ""ভীরুরা মরার আগে দু’বার মরে।"" means ""Cowards die twice before they actually die."" Idiomatically, it refers to how the fearful live in constant dread, suffering imaginary tragedies long before anything truly happens. It's used to push someone toward bravery or mock exaggerated anxiety. For the image, picture a person standing in front of a dark, ominous forest. Around them float ghostly visions—monsters, disasters, failures—all figments of their imagination, looming large. Behind these illusions, a narrow but clear trail leads to a golden light. The person is frozen mid-step, clutching their chest in terror, while their shadow lies behind them as if it had already fainted. Leaves swirl, and a full moon watches silently above. The emotional weight of anticipation overshadows the actual danger."
Images/3377.png,ভুল করা মানুষেরই ধর্ম।,To err is human.,Bhul kora manusher-i dhormo,Everyone makes mistakes.,"The Bengali idiom ""ভুল করা মানুষেরই ধর্ম।"" means ""To err is human."" Idiomatically, it shows compassion toward mistakes and recognizes them as an inseparable part of human nature. It's used to comfort someone who has made a mistake or to justify a human error. For a warm visual, imagine a kitchen where a child has accidentally spilled a bowl of flour while baking with a parent. Instead of scolding, the parent laughs gently and helps clean up, flour dust dancing in soft rays of sunlight. A drawing with a crooked house and misspelled words lies nearby, pinned proudly to the fridge. The environment is cozy—wooden shelves, warm tones, and tiny signs of imperfection everywhere, all celebrated. The image embodies forgiveness, learning, and love amidst human flaws"
Images/3378.png,মুখ দেখলেই মন বোঝা যায়।,You can read the mind from the face.,Mukh dekhlei mon bojha jay,Expressions reveal true feelings.,"The Bengali idiom ""মুখ দেখলেই মন বোঝা যায়"" means ""One can read someone’s mind just by looking at their face."" Idiomatically, it refers to the ability to intuitively or instantly understand a person’s feelings, thoughts, or emotions by observing their facial expressions or demeanor. This phrase is used in contexts where someone is so familiar or emotionally attuned to another person that their inner state becomes apparent without words, such as close friendships, parent-child relationships, or between lovers. For a detailed illustrative image capturing this idiom, imagine a serene domestic scene in a warmly lit living room. Two close family members—such as a mother and daughter, or a pair of longtime friends—sit facing each other across a table. One person looks up, their face slightly troubled yet open, while the other gazes back with gentle understanding and a soft smile of empathy. Their eyes meet, and a subtle glow or soft line flows visually between them to symbolize the invisible thread of emotional connectivity and mutual understanding. Around them, the room’s colors are warm and inviting, highlighting the intimacy and comfort that allows such deep, wordless communication. Their hands may rest on the table, close or slightly reaching out, further suggesting the bond that makes minds readable simply from a glance. The entire scene radiates a peaceful, heartfelt atmosphere, perfectly illustrating this idiom.]"
Images/3379.png,"মুর্খ বড় চম্বা, কাজ অষ্টারম্ভা।","The fool is boastful, starts eight things at once.","Murkh boro chomba, kaj ashtarambha",Fools boast but never finish anything.,"The Bengali idiom “মুর্খ বড় চম্বা, কাজ অষ্টারম্ভা” translates to “A fool is tall and broad, but his work starts at eight” in English. This warns that empty showmanship and grand posturing count for nothing when effort and follow-through are lacking. The image can be depicted as a towering, ostentatious figure in fine clothes standing beside eight half-finished tasks scattered on the ground—illustrating grand appearance with no real achievement.

"
Images/3380.png,মরণে ধন রক্ষা হয় না।,Wealth cannot be protected in death.,Morone dhon rokha hoy na,You can’t take wealth with you after death.,"The Bengali idiom “মরণে ধন রক্ষা হয় না” translates to “At death, wealth cannot be preserved” in English.

The image to capture this insight could show a hand holding a tiny, glowing ruby chip that outshines a whole basket of dull gray pebbles at its side—the lone sliver of gem radiant and attention-grabbing, while the abundant stones lie ignored—visually underscoring how real worth is measured by intrinsic value, not sheer volume.

Images/3400.png,মায়ের হাতে গড়া শিশু জগতের ভাগ্য বিধাতা,The child shaped by a mother is the world’s fate maker,Mayer hate gora shishu jagoter bhaggo bidhata,The values a mother instills shape the future of the world.,"This Bengali idiom “মায়ের হাতে গড়া শিশু জগতের ভাগ্য বিধাতা” literally translates to “A child shaped by a mother’s hands becomes the architect of the world’s destiny.”
The saying exalts a mother’s formative influence: the patience, values, and skills she instills in her child ripple outward, ultimately steering society’s future. It reminds us that nurturing the young is the most profound investment any community can make, because every great leader, thinker, or creator first learned compassion and discipline at a mother’s knee.
The image to represent this idiom could depict a mother gently molding a small clay figurine that, in a subtle gradient, transforms into a confident adult holding a glowing globe—her tender hands literally crafting the next shaper of the world."
Images/3401.png,মায়ের সামনে মামা বাড়ির গল্প করোনা,Don’t tell stories of your uncle’s house in front of your mother,Mayer samne mama barir golpo korona,Don’t praise outsiders in front of your own people.,"This Bengali idiom “মায়ের সামনে মামা বাড়ির গল্প করোনা” literally means “Do not tell stories of your uncle’s house in front of your mother.”
It cautions against praising another household—or by extension, another person’s possessions or hospitality—directly before your own family, because such comparisons may wound pride or suggest ingratitude for what you already have. At its core, the proverb urges tact: celebrate others’ virtues, but be sensitive to the feelings of those closest to you.
The image to capture this advice might show a child excitedly describing a lavish feast enjoyed at his uncle’s home while his mother, standing nearby with a modest meal in hand, looks quietly hurt—highlighting how unguarded admiration can unintentionally slight loved ones."
Images/3402.png,"মায়ের চেয়ে দরদ যার, তাকে বলে ডাইনি",One who loves more than a mother is called a witch,"Mayer cheye dorod jar, take bole daini",Excessive affection is often viewed with suspicion.,"This Bengali idiom “মায়ের চেয়ে দরদ যার, তাকে বলে ডাইনি” literally translates to “Anyone who shows more affection than a mother is called a witch.”
The proverb insists that no one can surpass a mother’s genuine love; when someone appears even kinder or more indulgent, their motives may be suspect. Historically, folk tales warned that witches lured children with excessive sweetness—so the saying functions both as praise for maternal devotion and as a caution against seductive, too-good-to-be-true generosity from outsiders.
An illustrative image could show a caring mother extending protective arms around her child while, just beyond a fence, a mysteriously smiling woman offers irresistible treats; villagers watch warily, underscoring the message that love surpassing a mother’s is often a dangerous illusion.

Images/3404.png,মুখেমুখে শেখা।,Learned by word of mouth.,Mukhe mukhe shekha,Learning by hearsay.,"The Bengali idiom ""মুখেমুখে শেখা"" means ""Learning by word of mouth."" Deeply rooted in Bengal’s oral traditions, this phrase alludes to rote memorization—learning lessons or scriptures by mere repetition without grasping the meaning or internalizing the knowledge. In village and urban Bengali societies alike, it carries a subtle warning: knowledge without understanding can be fragile, misleading, or even harmful. It’s often used to critique those who parrot others’ words or opinions uncritically, incapable of analysis or independent thought. Imagine a schoolroom where children recite lessons in unison, eyes vacant, their speech bubbles floating half-formed in the air—while, on a dusty bookshelf, a single glowing book hints at the depth left untouched. Shadows of ancestors behind them show generations passing down words, but the light of true understanding flickers only faintly amidst the chorus."
Images/3405.png,মুখ দেখলেই মন বোঝা যায়।,You can read the mind from the face.,Mukh dekhlei mon bojha jay,Expressions reveal true feelings.,"""মুখ দেখলেই মন বোঝা যায়"" translates to ""The mind is revealed upon seeing the face."" This idiom highlights the Bengali cultural intuition that facial expressions are windows to the soul. It reflects the importance placed on subtle emotional cues and sincerity within social interactions—joy, sorrow, worry, or duplicity are believed to radiate perceptibly from the face. Used when someone’s feelings are unmistakably written across their features, often in tales of friendship, love, or suspicion. Picture two friends on a shaded veranda: one’s face openly beams with hope, heart-shaped glimmers lighting her eyes, while the other’s furrowed brow and bit lip subtly betray anxiety. The world in their eyes is detailed—tiny vignettes of remembered joys or fears ghost across their faces, making the proverb literal and culturally vivid."
Images/3406.png,মধুর কথা কাজে লাগে না।,Sweet words are of no use.,Modhur kotha kaje lage na,Words are useless without action.,"""মধুর কথা কাজে লাগে না"" means ""Sweet words are of no use."" In Bengal’s pragmatic ethos, this idiom chastises those who offer honeyed flattery, empty promises, or poetic speech instead of substantial action. It asserts a central value: deeds, not words, bring change. Frequently invoked by elders chiding well-spoken but idle youth, especially in matters of marriage, work, or politics. Imagine a vibrant marketplace where a merchant lavishes compliments on potential buyers, spinning golden words into the air. Yet his wares—fruits and cloth—remain untouched and wilting, while a quieter competitor in the background quietly sells by honest service. The flattery floats like sweet-smelling smoke, dispersing to nothing as the demands of practical life loom in sharper relief."
Images/3407.png,মুকুট না আগুনের ডানা।,"Not a crown, but wings of fire.",Mukut na aguner dana,Danger disguised as reward.,"This bengali idiom, ""মুকুট না আগুনের ডানা"" is an evocative idiom: ""Is it a crown, or wings of fire?"" This phrase canonically questions whether something is an honor or a boon, or whether it carries hidden peril: a warning about the double-edged nature of power, status, or distinction. In Bengali society—steeped in tales of kings, saints, and tragic heroes—this idiom reflects caution against seeking glory without considering its burdens. It is often cited watching someone ascend to leadership or when family responsibilities are inherited. Picture a thoughtful figure standing on a dusk-lit balcony, a regal golden crown gradually becoming flames that curl into iridescent wings. Below, admirers cheer, but in the glinting firelight, worried elders and jealous rivals cast uneasy glances, their faces aglow with reflected danger."
Images/3408.png,"মুর্খ বড় চম্বা, কাজ অষ্টারম্ভা।","The fool is boastful, starts eight things at once.","Murkh boro chomba, kaj ashtarambha",Fools boast but never finish anything.,"The idiom ""মুর্খ বড় চম্বা, কাজ অষ্টারম্ভা"" describes the archetypal boastful fool—a person who talks loudly about their talents and ambitions, but never finishes what they start, instead launching into a new project each day. It’s a staple of Bengali satire—mocking the windbag whose grandiosity masks ineptitude and lack of persistence. Used in stories and daily banter about procrastination or inflated egos, it cautions that empty speech and unfinished business only create chaos. For an image, imagine a cluttered courtyard: a person in outlandish clothes stands atop a crate, gesturing dramatically about their “great plans,” while around them lie abandoned tools, half-woven baskets, and a crowd of unimpressed neighbors and snickering children. A straw hat fallen on the ground is a silent symbol of the work left incomplete."
Images/3409.png,"মুর্খের মধুর ভাষা, অন্তরে বিষ।",The fool’s sweet words hide poison.,"Murkher modhur bhasa, ontore bish",Don’t trust flattery from fools.,"""মুর্খের মধুর ভাষা, অন্তরে বিষ"" means ""The sweet words of a fool hide poison within."" Its roots lie in the Bengali suspicion of charm without substance—words spoken by an unwise or malicious person may mask jealousy, deceit, or hidden malice. This idiom serves as a powerful warning not to be swayed by empty flattery from those who lack wisdom, as dangers may be concealed beneath. It is frequently invoked in tales of betrayal or manipulation. Imagine a busy village scene: a charismatic figure showers compliments and honey-combed treats to all who pass, yet from beneath his cloak, a venomous snake weaves towards the unsuspecting. The faces around him are charmed but subtly uneasy, and faint storm clouds swirl in the shadows."
Images/3410.png,মরণে ধন রক্ষা হয় না।,Wealth cannot be protected in death.,Morone dhon rokha hoy na,You can’t take wealth with you after death.,"The idiom ""মরণে ধন রক্ষা হয় না""—""In death, wealth cannot be preserved""—conveys a deep philosophical truth embedded in Bengali culture: the impermanence of material possessions versus the enduring value of virtue and legacy. It is used to caution against greed, reminding that all must be left behind at life’s end, thereby advocating generosity, charity, and spiritual focus. For a richly layered image, picture an elderly, wealthy merchant clutching bags of gold and jewels while an ethereal, serene spirit beckons him from a softly glowing doorway. The riches drip like sand from his desperate grip, pooling uselessly on the threshold to the next world. Around him, faded ancestral portraits suggest that, in the memory of the living, compassion and good deeds shine brighter than any treasure left behind."
Images/3411.png,মৃত্যু বলে কয়ে আসে না।,Death does not announce before coming.,Mrityu bole koy ashe na,Death comes unexpectedly.,"The Bengali idiom “মৃত্যু বলে কয়ে আসে না” translates to “Death arrives without announcement” in English. It stresses that death intrudes silently, without warning or ceremony.

It warns that appearances are insufficient proof; substance must follow. The image can be depicted as a sky heavy with dark clouds but dry earth below—illustrating that promise alone does not guarantee outcome.

It echoes “Haste makes waste,” warning that frantic speed often results in losing everything. The image can be depicted as a runner sprinting so carelessly that he trips over his own shoelaces and stumbles—illustrating self-defeat through haste."
